"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Security","System/E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user's account is temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed OTP login attempts, as per REQ-FUN-002 and CUS-005.","High - Failure to lock accounts exposes the system to brute-force attacks and potential SMS billing fraud.","Medium","A registered customer account exists. The authentication service and Redis cache are running.","1. Navigate to the customer login page. 2. Enter the valid mobile number. 3. Request an OTP. 4. Intentionally enter an incorrect OTP 5 times. 5. Verify the 'Account Locked' message is displayed. 6. Attempt to request a new OTP and verify it is blocked.","After the 5th failed attempt, the API returns a 429 'Too Many Attempts' error with a message indicating the account is locked for 15 minutes. Subsequent OTP requests within this period are also rejected.","A valid customer test account (mobile number). A mechanism to retrieve the valid OTP for comparison.","Cypress (or Detox/Appium for mobile); Postman (for API-level verification); Redis client.","6","12","4","Identity & Access Service; Redis Cache; Notification Service.","Integration environment with all dependent services.","Account lock is successfully triggered. Subsequent login attempts are blocked for the configured duration.","Critical - High security vulnerability.","Every release","Low","Clear the lockout key for the user in Redis after the test.","The test must not cause a permanent denial of service for the test account. Ensure cleanup procedures are robust.","The lockout check should add <20ms latency to the API response.","The error message must be announced by screen readers."
"TEST-ORD-005","Order Fulfillment","Functional","System/E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end happy path of a prepaid order: Customer places order -> Vendor accepts -> Rider is allocated -> Rider completes delivery -> Customer is prompted to rate.","Critical - This is the primary revenue-generating workflow of the platform.","High","Test accounts exist for a Customer, Vendor, and Rider. The Rider is 'Online'. The Vendor's store is 'Online'. All microservices are running.","1. Customer logs in, adds an item to cart, and completes payment via Razorpay sandbox. 2. Vendor logs in, verifies the new order appears, and accepts it. 3. Vendor marks the order 'Ready for Pickup'. 4. System allocates the task to the Rider. 5. Rider logs in, accepts the task, and updates status through pickup and delivery. 6. Customer receives all status notifications. 7. After delivery, customer opens the app and is prompted to rate the order.","The order successfully transitions through all states ('Pending' -> 'Accepted' -> 'Preparing' -> 'Ready for Pickup' -> 'In Transit' -> 'Delivered'). All notifications are sent. Financial records are created correctly.","Active test accounts for all 3 user roles. Configured product in vendor's catalog. Razorpay sandbox credentials.","Cypress (for Vendor/Admin dashboards); Detox/Appium (for Customer/Rider apps); Mail/SMS testing tool.","12","30","10","All core microservices (Identity, Order, Vendor, Rider, Payments, Notifications).","Staging environment with all services and external integrations configured.","Order completes successfully with all state transitions logged correctly. All user-facing components reflect the correct status in real-time.","Critical - A failure in this flow breaks the core business function.","Every release, and on a nightly schedule.","High","Reset state of all users (Rider available, Vendor open), cancel created orders if test fails mid-run.","Test data must use sandbox credentials. No real financial transactions.","Entire flow should feel responsive to the user, with status updates appearing within 2-3 seconds.","N/A for E2E flow, tested at component level."
"TEST-VND-014","Vendor Catalog Management","Functional","System/E2E","High","true","High","Verify that a vendor can bulk import a CSV with mixed valid and invalid data, receives an error report, and can download it, as per VND-013 and VND-014.","Medium - A buggy import feature can cause significant data corruption and vendor frustration.","High","A vendor account exists. The bulk import feature is enabled. The SQS queue and worker for processing imports are running.","1. Vendor logs into the dashboard and navigates to 'Products'. 2. Vendor uploads a specially crafted CSV file containing 5 valid rows and 3 invalid rows (e.g., missing price, non-numeric stock). 3. Verify the UI shows 'Processing...'. 4. After processing, verify the UI shows a summary: 'Import complete: 5 products created/updated, 3 rows failed.' 5. Click the 'Download Error Report' link. 6. Open the downloaded CSV and verify it contains only the 3 failed rows with a new 'Error_Description' column explaining the errors.","The system correctly imports valid data, rejects invalid data, and provides a precise, downloadable error report, ensuring an atomic transaction principle is followed (all-or-nothing for the whole file, or per-row success/failure as defined).","A test vendor account. A CSV file with a mix of valid and invalid product data.","Cypress; CSV parsing library for test validation; AWS SQS/S3 console access for verification.","8","20","8","Vendor & Catalog Service; SQS; S3.","Integration or Staging environment.","Valid products are created/updated. Invalid products are not. The error report is accurate and downloadable.","High - Corrupts vendor catalog data and breaks a key onboarding feature.","Every release.","Medium","Delete the created products and the uploaded files from S3.","The CSV parser must be hardened against injection attacks (e.g., formula injection). The download link must be a secure, time-limited pre-signed URL.","Processing a 1,000-row CSV should complete in under 2 minutes.","N/A for the core logic; UI components are tested separately."
"TEST-PERF-001","Product Discovery","Performance","System/E2E","High","true","High","Verify that the product search API meets the P95 latency requirement of <500ms under load, as per REQ-FUN-004.","High - Slow search leads to customer frustration and abandonment.","Medium","A dedicated performance testing environment is available. The OpenSearch index is populated with a large, realistic dataset.","1. Ramp up virtual users over 2 minutes to a target of 100 concurrent users. 2. Each user executes a search query from a predefined list of common search terms. 3. Sustain the load for 10 minutes. 4. Monitor the P95 response time for the search API endpoint.","The 95th percentile response time for the search API remains below 500ms throughout the test duration.
