"RISK-001","Timeline","The complexity of the 'Bulk Product Import from CSV' feature (WI-009) is significantly underestimated. The vast number of edge cases in CSV parsing, row-by-row validation, atomic transaction management, and robust error reporting could cause major timeline overruns, delaying a critical vendor onboarding feature.","4","4","16","High","WI-009 (Implement Bulk Product Import from CSV), WI-011 (Implement Admin Interface for Validating Migrated Data), and overall vendor onboarding timeline.","Inherent complexity of file-based bulk data processing and the high number of validation rules. High story point estimate (13) already indicates significant uncertainty.","Break down WI-009 into smaller sub-tasks (e.g., Parser, Validator, DB Writer, Report Generator). Execute a time-boxed technical spike to validate the chosen parsing library and benchmark performance. Prioritize a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the feature that only handles new product creation, deferring the 'update' logic.","For initial launch, rely on the internal data transformation script (WI-010) combined with a semi-automated import process managed by the onboarding team, deferring the self-service vendor feature.","Velocity on import-related sub-tasks is 25% lower than projected after two sprints. The number of bugs related to CSV parsing exceeds 5 during the first QA cycle.","Product Manager","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure to correctly implement the distributed transaction pattern (e.g., Transactional Outbox/Saga) for events like vendor status changes (WI-002) leads to data inconsistency between the Vendor service database and downstream consumers, causing issues like customers seeing closed stores as open.","3","5","15","High","WI-002 (Implement Store Availability Toggle), WI-003 (Implement Vendor License Management API & Scheduled Job), any feature requiring event publishing after a database write.","The inherent complexity of ensuring atomicity in a distributed microservices architecture. Lack of team experience with robust event-driven patterns.","Mandate the use of a vetted Transactional Outbox pattern implementation. Conduct a mandatory architectural design review for the first service that uses this pattern. Implement a comprehensive integration test suite that simulates failures (e.g., message broker down) to verify compensation logic.","Develop and schedule periodic reconciliation jobs that compare data between services to detect and report inconsistencies for manual correction.","A high number of messages in the event topic's Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). Any single critical data inconsistency reported during UAT.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Inadequate end-to-end (E2E) testing coverage for asynchronous, event-driven workflows (e.g., license expiration check to vendor suspension). This can lead to critical business logic failures that are not caught by unit or simple integration tests, only appearing under specific conditions in production.","3","5","15","High","WI-003 (License Job), WI-008 (Export CSV), WI-009 (Import CSV), WI-002 (Status Toggle). Essentially all features relying on background jobs or events.","The difficulty and time commitment required to create and maintain reliable E2E tests for complex, asynchronous systems, often leading teams to de-prioritize them.","Allocate specific story points for E2E test creation for each asynchronous feature. Mandate that E2E tests for critical paths must pass in the CI/CD pipeline before a deployment to staging or production can proceed. Utilize tools like Cypress or Playwright with backend hooks to control and verify states.","Institute mandatory, structured manual testing sessions ('bug bashes') focused exclusively on cross-service user journeys before each release.","The ratio of E2E tests to features drops below a defined threshold (e.g., 1 E2E test per user story). E2E test suite becomes flaky, with a failure rate >10% on valid code changes.","QA Lead","2024-12-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","Development is blocked due to delays in dependent internal services (e.g., Order Management, Identity, Audit) that do not provide their APIs or event contracts in a timely manner, preventing integration and E2E testing.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-005 (Product CRUD depends on Order service), WI-011 (depends on Audit service), EPIC-001 (depends on Identity service).","Poor cross-team communication and lack of a formalized API contract-first development approach in a microservices environment.","Implement a strict API contract-first workflow using OpenAPI. Use consumer-driven contract testing (e.g., Pact) to automatically validate that provider services do not introduce breaking changes. Hold weekly cross-team dependency sync meetings.","Develop against mocked API responses based on the agreed-upon OpenAPI contract. This unblocks frontend and some backend logic while waiting for the actual dependency to be deployed.","An API contract for a dependency is not finalized by the planned date. The integration environment for a dependent service is unavailable for more than two consecutive days.","Project Manager","2024-11-08","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Performance degradation of critical, high-throughput APIs like the real-time inventory check (WI-007) or product search queries at scale. Inefficient database queries or a lack of proper indexing could lead to SLO violations, increased cart abandonment, and a poor user experience.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-007 (Real-time Inventory Check), WI-008 (Bulk Export), WI-005 (Product read operations).","Rapidly growing data volume in the products and inventory tables without proactive database performance management and query optimization.","Mandate load testing as a 'Definition of Done' criteria for all critical APIs. All database queries must be reviewed using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for efficiency. Implement and enforce a caching strategy (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed, semi-static data.","Develop a database scaling plan, including the use of read replicas to offload read-heavy queries. Have a clear procedure for identifying and optimizing slow queries in production.","P95 latency for a critical API exceeds 75% of its SLO for more than an hour. Database CPU utilization consistently exceeds 80% during peak hours.","DevOps Engineer","2024-12-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","Security misconfiguration of AWS S3 pre-signed URLs (WI-005) or IAM roles (WI-013), leading to unauthorized access to sensitive vendor documents or product images. This could result in a significant data breach, causing reputational and legal damage.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-005 (Product CRUD with Image Upload), WI-008 (Export), WI-009 (Import), WI-013 (Terraform Infra).","The complexity of configuring least-privilege IAM policies and secure S3 bucket policies. Human error during manual configuration or in Terraform code.","Use automated security scanning tools for Terraform code (e.g., `tfsec`) in the CI pipeline. Mandate peer review for all changes to IAM or S3 configurations. Use the shortest practical expiry time for pre-signed URLs. Implement bucket policies that restrict access by default.","Have an incident response runbook that includes steps to immediately rotate all credentials, revoke active sessions, and lock down S3 buckets if a breach is suspected.","Enable and configure AWS CloudTrail and S3 access logging. Set up AWS GuardDuty alerts for unusual S3 access patterns or IAM activity.","Security Engineer","2024-11-22","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","The asynchronous CSV import/export jobs (WI-008, WI-009) fail silently without alerting the operations team. A bug in the worker process or a poison pill message in the SQS queue could halt all bulk operations, impacting vendor onboarding and data management without immediate visibility.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-008 (Bulk Export), WI-009 (Bulk Import).","Lack of comprehensive monitoring and alerting specifically for background worker processes and their associated queues.","Configure a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for the SQS jobs. Set up a CloudWatch alarm that triggers a critical alert if the number of messages in the DLQ exceeds zero. Implement custom Prometheus metrics to track the number of jobs processed, failed, and their average duration.","Develop a runbook for investigating and reprocessing messages from the DLQ. The worker logic must be idempotent to allow for safe reprocessing.","CloudWatch Alarm: `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` in DLQ > 0. Prometheus Alert: Rate of successfully processed jobs drops to zero for more than 15 minutes.","SRE/DevOps Team","2024-12-06","Not Started"
