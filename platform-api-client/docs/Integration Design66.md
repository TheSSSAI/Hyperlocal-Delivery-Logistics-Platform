## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-101

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The project shall enforce strict code quality and maintainability standards. All backend services must achieve and maintain a minimum of 80% code coverage from unit and integration tests. All APIs must be documented using the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. A consistent coding style must be enforced across all repositories using automated linters and formatters. All code merged into the main branch must go through a formal code review process requiring at least one peer approval.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that an up-to-date OpenAPI specification is generated and available for all services.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The primary implementation strategy for this library is to generate its code directly from the backend's published OpenAPI specification.
- The build process for this repository MUST include a step that fetches the latest OpenAPI contract and runs the code generator.
- This library serves as the consumer-side enforcement of the OpenAPI contract, ensuring type-safe communication between frontend and backend.
- The versioning of this library should be closely tied to the version of the API contract it is built against.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is critically relevant as it dictates the core implementation methodology of the platform-api-client. The library's existence is a direct consequence of the mandate to use an OpenAPI specification for all APIs, providing a standardized and type-safe client for all frontend applications.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-096

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall use AWS Cognito for user authentication and identity management. The authentication strategy must use short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens. Authorization shall be managed via a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, with permission checks enforced at both the API Gateway layer and within each individual microservice.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- After a successful login, inspect the client application's storage to verify the presence of an access token and a refresh token.
- Log out of the application and verify that the stored refresh token is no longer valid for generating new access tokens.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The API client must implement a mechanism to handle the JWT access/refresh token lifecycle.
- An Axios interceptor is required to automatically attach the access token to every request.
- The interceptor must also handle 401 Unauthorized responses by using the refresh token to fetch a new access token and then transparently retrying the original request.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines the authentication strategy that this client library is responsible for encapsulating. Centralizing this complex logic is a primary purpose of this repository.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-092

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall enforce secure and standardized communication protocols. All client-server communication must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Real-time features like live tracking and chat must use the Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol. The data interchange format for all APIs must be JSON. All public-facing APIs must be versioned in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/).

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Use a network analysis tool to confirm that all API traffic is encrypted over HTTPS.
- Inspect API responses and confirm they are in valid JSON format.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The Axios instance within this library must be configured to use a base URL that enforces HTTPS.
- All generated methods will expect and return JSON payloads, with types derived from the OpenAPI specification and the contracts library.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement sets the communication standard that the API client must adhere to for all its interactions with the backend.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'ApiClient', 'component_specification': "A shared utility library that provides a fully-typed, consistent, and robust API client for all frontend applications to interact with the platform's backend API Gateway. It encapsulates API request/response handling, JWT access/refresh token management, and centralized error handling.", 'implementation_requirements': ["Must be generated using the OpenAPI Generator tool from the backend's published OpenAPI v3 specification.", 'Must use Axios for underlying HTTP requests.', 'Must implement Axios interceptors to automatically inject the JWT access token into the Authorization header of every request.', 'Must implement logic within an interceptor to handle 401 Unauthorized responses by using the refresh token to request a new access token, and then retry the original request.', 'Must be published as a private NPM package to be consumed by all frontend applications.'], 'architectural_context': "This is a shared utility library residing in the Presentation Layer's ecosystem. It acts as a standardized Data Access Layer (DAL) for all client applications, abstracting the communication with the API Gateway Layer.", 'extraction_reasoning': "This is the primary and sole component within the platform-api-client repository. It was decomposed from the four main frontend applications to eliminate code duplication and enforce a consistent, secure, and type-safe method of communicating with the backend, fulfilling the repository's core purpose."}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

### 1.4.1.0 Layer Name

#### 1.4.1.1 Layer Name

Presentation Layer

#### 1.4.1.2 Layer Responsibilities

This layer comprises the client applications that provide user interfaces. This library is a foundational utility that supports these applications by handling all backend communication.

#### 1.4.1.3 Layer Constraints

- The library itself must not contain any UI rendering or presentation logic.
- The library must not manage application-level state (e.g., Redux, Zustand); its responsibility ends at returning data or errors from an API call.

#### 1.4.1.4 Implementation Patterns

- Data Access Object (DAO)
- Singleton (for the Axios instance)
- Interceptor

#### 1.4.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

The platform-api-client library is explicitly mapped to the Presentation Layer as it is a client-side utility consumed directly by the four frontend applications (Customer, Rider, Vendor, Admin) which constitute this layer. It provides the data fetching capabilities for the UI components within these applications.

### 1.4.2.0 Layer Name

#### 1.4.2.1 Layer Name

Cross-Cutting Concerns

#### 1.4.2.2 Layer Responsibilities

Handles functionalities applicable across multiple services. This library centralizes the cross-cutting concern of client-to-backend communication.

#### 1.4.2.3 Layer Constraints

- Libraries in this layer must be highly stable and have minimal dependencies.

#### 1.4.2.4 Implementation Patterns

- Shared Library

#### 1.4.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

By centralizing API communication and authentication logic for all four frontend applications, this library perfectly embodies the principle of a cross-cutting concern, promoting code reuse and consistency.

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

### 1.5.1.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.1.1 Interface Name

IPlatformApiGateway

#### 1.5.1.2 Source Repository

API Gateway

#### 1.5.1.3 Method Contracts

- {'method_name': '* (All Endpoints)', 'method_signature': "Defined by the project's unified OpenAPI v3 Specification", 'method_purpose': 'Exposes all backend functionalities to external clients, including authentication, order management, user profiles, product discovery, and logistics.', 'integration_context': 'The platform-api-client will generate typed methods to call every endpoint defined in the OpenAPI specification published by the API Gateway.'}

#### 1.5.1.4 Integration Pattern

API Client Generation

#### 1.5.1.5 Communication Protocol

HTTPS/REST with JSON payloads

#### 1.5.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

The entire purpose of the platform-api-client is to be a client for the API Gateway. Its primary dependency is the formal contract (OpenAPI specification) that the gateway exposes. The client's code is directly generated from this contract.

### 1.5.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.2.1 Interface Name

IPlatformContracts

#### 1.5.2.2 Source Repository

platform-lib-contracts

#### 1.5.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.2.4 Integration Pattern

Type Imports (NPM Package)

#### 1.5.2.5 Communication Protocol

N/A (TypeScript type definitions)

#### 1.5.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

To ensure end-to-end type safety and a single source of truth for data structures, the client library will not define its own DTOs. Instead, it will be configured during generation to import all DTO types directly from the `platform-lib-contracts` shared library.

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'IApiClient', 'consumer_repositories': ['platform-mobile-customer', 'platform-mobile-rider', 'platform-web-vendor', 'platform-web-admin'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'requestOtp', 'method_signature': 'requestOtp(payload: RequestOtpDTO): Promise<void>', 'method_purpose': 'Initiates the OTP login/registration process for a given mobile number.', 'implementation_requirements': 'Generated from the `/api/v1/auth/otp` endpoint in the OpenAPI spec.'}, {'method_name': 'verifyOtp', 'method_signature': 'verifyOtp(payload: VerifyOtpDTO): Promise<AuthTokensDTO>', 'method_purpose': 'Verifies a submitted OTP and returns JWT access/refresh tokens upon success.', 'implementation_requirements': 'Generated from the `/api/v1/auth/verify` endpoint in the OpenAPI spec.'}, {'method_name': 'createOrder', 'method_signature': 'createOrder(payload: CreateOrderDTO): Promise<OrderDTO>', 'method_purpose': "Submits a customer's cart to create a new order.", 'implementation_requirements': 'Generated from the `POST /api/v1/orders` endpoint in the OpenAPI spec.'}, {'method_name': 'getVendorById', 'method_signature': 'getVendorById(vendorId: string): Promise<VendorProfileDTO>', 'method_purpose': 'Fetches the detailed profile and product catalog for a specific vendor.', 'implementation_requirements': 'Generated from the `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}` endpoint in the OpenAPI spec.'}, {'method_name': 'updateOrderStatus', 'method_signature': 'updateOrderStatus(orderId: string, payload: UpdateStatusDTO): Promise<OrderDTO>', 'method_purpose': 'Allows authorized users (Vendor, Rider, Admin) to update the status of an order.', 'implementation_requirements': 'Generated from the `PATCH /api/v1/orders/{orderId}/status` endpoint in the OpenAPI spec.'}], 'service_level_requirements': ['All methods must be asynchronous and return Promises.', 'The client must transparently handle JWT refresh logic without requiring the consumer to intervene.'], 'implementation_constraints': ['The client must be framework-agnostic but can provide optional helpers for React-based frameworks.', 'The client must be configurable with the base API URL for different environments (Dev, Staging, Prod).', "The client must be configurable with a 'TokenProvider' to decouple it from the specific token storage mechanism of the consuming application."], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository's primary purpose is to provide a standardized, type-safe client for all frontend applications. The IApiClient interface is the public contract it exposes to its consumers, abstracting away all the complexities of HTTP communication and authentication."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The library is framework-agnostic, built with TypeScript and Axios. It does not use a specific application framework like React or Angular.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- TypeScript: For type safety and code generation.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests and implementing interceptors for auth and error handling.
- OpenAPI Generator: The core tool used in the build process to generate the client from the OpenAPI specification.

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

The client should support request cancellation to prevent unnecessary network traffic. The built-in interceptors must be highly performant to avoid adding significant latency to each API request.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

The client is responsible for managing the JWT access and refresh tokens. It must be provided with a secure token storage mechanism by the consuming application and implement the token refresh flow correctly to maintain user sessions without exposing credentials.
