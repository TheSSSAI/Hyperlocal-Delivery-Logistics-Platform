# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Provide a fully-typed, centralized API client (SDK) for all frontend applications to interact with the backend API Gateway.
- Secondary: Encapsulate and manage authentication logic, specifically the attachment of JWT access tokens and the handling of token refresh cycles.
- Out of Scope: This library is not responsible for UI components, application state management, or direct interaction with microservices; it exclusively targets the API Gateway.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- TypeScript: For providing compile-time type safety for all API requests and responses.
- Axios: As the underlying HTTP client for making requests.
- OpenAPI Generator: For automated generation of client methods and data transfer object (DTO) types from the backend's OpenAPI specification.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- The client's structure and methods must be derived from a published OpenAPI specification, making the specification the single source of truth for the API contract.
- The library must be stateless regarding user data but stateful regarding authentication tokens, managing the access/refresh token lifecycle via interceptors.
- Must be published as a versioned package to a private registry (e.g., NPM) to be consumed as a dependency by all frontend applications.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-api-client' is a critical foundational library that enforces the API Gateway pattern on the client side. Its primary value is abstracting away the complexities of HTTP requests, authentication, and type safety, allowing frontend developers to interact with the backend as if it were a local, typed module. Its implementation complexity lies not in the generated API methods, but in the robust configuration of Axios interceptors to handle the JWT refresh token lifecycle seamlessly.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

- {'requirement_id': 'REQ-1-003', 'requirement_description': 'The system shall implement core functional modules like User Onboarding, Order Placement, etc.', 'implementation_implications': ['The API client must provide generated, type-safe methods corresponding to every backend endpoint required to fulfill these functional modules.', "For example, User Onboarding will be enabled by methods like 'apiClient.auth.registerWithOtp()' and 'apiClient.auth.verifyOtp()'."], 'required_components': ['OpenAPI Generator', 'Axios'], 'analysis_reasoning': 'This library is the direct enabler for the frontend applications to implement any functional requirement that necessitates backend communication. It provides the low-level communication toolkit.'}

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-096: Use short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens. Enforce authorization at the API Gateway.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

This is a primary driver for the library's design. An Axios interceptor must be implemented to: 1. Attach the current access token to every outgoing request's Authorization header. 2. Catch 401 Unauthorized responses. 3. Use the refresh token to request a new access token. 4. Retry the original request with the new token. 5. Handle refresh token expiry by logging the user out.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- The library needs a method to be configured with token retrieval/storage functions provided by the consuming application.
- The token refresh logic must be robust and handle concurrent requests gracefully.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Centralizing this complex authentication logic in the API client is critical for security and maintainability, preventing its duplication and potential misimplementation across four different frontend applications.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Code Quality

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-101: Maintain 80% code coverage, use OpenAPI spec, enforce consistent coding style.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

This requirement is directly mapped to this repository. The custom wrapper code (e.g., Axios configuration, interceptors) must have unit tests achieving >80% coverage. The use of OpenAPI is fundamental to the library's existence. Linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier) must be integrated into the CI pipeline.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- CI pipeline must have steps for linting, testing, and code coverage reporting.
- Generated code is typically excluded from coverage metrics.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

As a core shared library, its quality and reliability are paramount. Adhering to REQ-1-101 ensures it is a stable foundation for all client applications.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Communication Protocol

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-092: All client-server communication must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. APIs must be versioned.

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

The Axios instance must be configured with a base URL that uses 'https://' and includes the API version prefix (e.g., 'https://api.example.com/api/v1').

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- The base URL must be an external configuration parameter, not hardcoded.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The library enforces this security requirement for all outgoing communications from any client application.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The API client library is a direct implementation of several critical non-functional requirements, particularly around security, communication standards, and code quality. While it doesn't implement business-level functional requirements itself, it is the essential enabler for all of them by providing the standardized and secure communication layer for the entire presentation layer.
