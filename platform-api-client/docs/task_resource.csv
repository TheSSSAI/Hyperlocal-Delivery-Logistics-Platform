"VND-007-T2","[Backend] Implement Event Publishing for Status Change","Event-Driven Architecture","NestJS,AWS SNS,Transactional Outbox","High","8.3","Senior","1.2","11.2","1","","VND-007-T1","true","Medium","2","Requires expertise in distributed transactions (Saga/Outbox) to ensure data consistency. High risk of data inconsistency if not implemented correctly.","Use a simpler, non-transactional event publish, but this increases risk. A reconciliation job would be needed as a backup.","Data inconsistency between services if the atomic update-and-publish fails.","Mandate Transactional Outbox pattern. Require extensive integration testing simulating message broker failures.","1.66","0.83","0.42","2","1.5"

Requires efficient data streaming and atomic database transactions to handle large files and prevent partial imports.","Process the file in-memory without streaming, but this poses a high risk of memory overflow for large files.","Performance bottlenecks with large CSV files; transaction management complexity.","Implement streaming for file processing. Use database transactions per batch of rows, not for the entire file.","3.34","1.67","0.84","3","2"

This simplifies the logic but creates a poor user experience if a customer has an active order for a deleted product.","Dependency on external Order Management service API availability and latency.","Implement a circuit breaker pattern for the cross-service call.
