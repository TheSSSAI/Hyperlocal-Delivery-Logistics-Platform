"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","High dependency on a single Senior DevOps Engineer creates a critical bottleneck and single point of failure for all infrastructure and deployment tasks.","High","High","[""WI-012-T1"",""WI-013-T1"",""WI-014-T1"",""SYS-004-T3""]","2","Initiate immediate cross-training for one of the mid-level backend developers on CI/CD maintenance and basic Terraform. Document all DevOps processes.","Engage the central DevOps team for support, though this may come with delays. Have a pre-vetted DevOps contractor on standby.","DevOps tasks are delayed by more than 2 days.","","4 weeks for initial cross-training."
"RISK-R002","Capacity","The single QA Engineer is over-utilized, especially in Sprints 2 and 3, which could lead to testing becoming a bottleneck, reduced quality, or burnout.","High","Medium","[""VND-009-T4"",""VND-011-T3"",""VND-014-T3""]","1","Implement a 'shift-left' quality strategy where developers are responsible for writing more comprehensive integration and E2E tests. QA focuses on test strategy, exploratory testing, and performance testing.","Allocate budget for a part-time manual QA contractor during the final two sprints to assist with regression and exploratory testing.","QA task backlog exceeds 5 tasks at any point.","10000","Ongoing."
"RISK-R003","Technical","The complexity of implementing a robust Transactional Outbox pattern (VND-007-T2) could be underestimated, leading to data consistency issues between microservices.","Medium","High","[""VND-007-T2"",""SYS-005-T2""]","1","Conduct a mandatory architectural design review for the Transactional Outbox implementation. Allocate time for paired programming between the Senior dev and the Mid-level dev implementing it.","If implementation proves too complex, fall back to a simpler event publishing model and build periodic reconciliation jobs to clean up data inconsistencies.","High number of messages in the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for any event topic.","","1 week."
