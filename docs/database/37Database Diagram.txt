This ER diagram illustrates the database schema for the Identity & Access Service. The central 'User' entity manages core identity and authentication information. It has a one-to-one relationship with 'CustomerProfile' for customer-specific details and one-to-many relationships with 'Address', 'UserConsent', 'AuditLog', and 'SystemConfiguration'. This structure enables tracking user addresses, consents, and administrative actions efficiently.
