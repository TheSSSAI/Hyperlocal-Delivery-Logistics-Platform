This diagram illustrates the structure of the 'ProductDocument', which is a denormalized document for an Amazon OpenSearch index. It consolidates product, vendor, and category data into a single entity to optimize for fast and complex search operations. As this is a denormalized schema for a search index, there are no explicit relationships shown; all relevant data is contained within the document's attributes.
