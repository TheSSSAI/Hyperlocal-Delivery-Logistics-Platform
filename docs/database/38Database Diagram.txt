This ER diagram illustrates the database schema for the Vendor & Catalog Service. The central 'VendorProfile' entity stores core vendor information. It has one-to-many relationships with 'VendorBusinessHour' for operating times, 'VendorLicense' for legal licenses, and 'ProductCategory' for organizing products. The 'Product' entity, which represents items for sale, is linked to both its parent 'VendorProfile' and its respective 'ProductCategory'.
