This diagram illustrates the structure of the RiderLocationEvent table within the Amazon Timestream database. It is designed as a time-series model to efficiently store and query historical GPS location data for riders. The table uses a composite primary key consisting of 'time' and 'riderId' to uniquely identify each location event. 'riderId' serves as a dimension for filtering and aggregation, while latitude, longitude, and accuracy are the measured values.
