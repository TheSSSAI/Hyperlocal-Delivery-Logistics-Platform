This ER diagram visualizes the database schema for an Order Management Service. The central 'Order' table holds core transaction details. It has one-to-many relationships with 'OrderItem', which lists the specific products in an order, and 'OrderStatusHistory', which tracks the order's progress through various statuses. This design allows for detailed tracking of customer purchases and their lifecycle.
