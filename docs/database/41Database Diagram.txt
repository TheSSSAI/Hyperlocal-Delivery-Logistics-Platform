This ER diagram illustrates the database schema for the Payments & Settlements Service. It shows the core entities: 'Payment' for transaction records, 'Payout' for fund settlements, and 'FinancialTransaction' which serves as a double-entry ledger. The diagram highlights the relationship where a 'Payout' can be associated with multiple 'FinancialTransaction' entries, linking settlement actions to their corresponding ledger records. The 'Payment' entity, while part of the same service, is not directly linked via a foreign key in this schema.
