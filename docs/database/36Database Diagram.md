This diagram illustrates the complete database schema for a hyperlocal delivery platform. It covers user management, vendor and product catalogs, order processing, delivery logistics, financials, and support systems. The central 'User' entity is linked to specific profiles (Customer, Vendor, Rider). The 'Order' entity is the transactional core, connecting customers, vendors, products, and delivery tasks. The schema includes tables for logging, auditing, and configuration to ensure scalability and maintainability.
