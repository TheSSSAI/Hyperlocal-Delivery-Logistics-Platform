This ER diagram illustrates the database schema for a rider logistics service. It shows the core entities: RiderProfile for rider data, DeliveryTask for jobs, and ProofOfDelivery for verification. It also includes RiderLocationHistory for tracking and OperationalZone for service areas. The relationships show that a rider can perform multiple tasks, and each completed task requires a single proof of delivery. A rider's location history is also tracked over time.
