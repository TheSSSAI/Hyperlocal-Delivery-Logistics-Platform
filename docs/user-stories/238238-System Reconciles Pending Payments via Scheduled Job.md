# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Reconciliation of a successfully completed payment

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

An order exists in the database with the status 'payment_pending_confirmation' and has a valid payment gateway transaction ID.

### 3.1.5 When

The scheduled payment reconciliation job runs and queries the payment gateway API, which returns a 'success' status for the transaction.

### 3.1.6 Then

The order's status is updated to 'pending_vendor_acceptance', a new entry is added to the order's event log detailing the change, a notification is sent to the vendor for the new order, and the job logs the successful reconciliation.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the order status in the database, check the order event log, confirm the vendor notification was queued, and inspect the application logs for the success message.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Reconciliation of a failed payment

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

An order exists in the database with the status 'payment_pending_confirmation' and has a valid payment gateway transaction ID.

### 3.2.5 When

The scheduled payment reconciliation job runs and queries the payment gateway API, which returns a 'failed' status for the transaction.

### 3.2.6 Then

The order's status is updated to 'cancelled', a new entry is added to the order's event log, a notification is sent to the customer about the payment failure, and the job logs the successful reconciliation.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the order status is 'cancelled', check the order event log, confirm the customer notification was queued, and inspect the application logs.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Handling a payment that is still pending at the gateway

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

An order exists in the database with the status 'payment_pending_confirmation'.

### 3.3.5 When

The reconciliation job queries the payment gateway API, which returns a 'pending' or 'in_progress' status.

### 3.3.6 Then

The order's status remains 'payment_pending_confirmation', a 'reconciliation_attempts' counter on the order record is incremented, and the job logs that the payment is still pending.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Check that the order status has not changed and that the attempt counter has been incremented in the database.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Handling a stale order that has been pending for too long

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

An order has been in the 'payment_pending_confirmation' state for longer than a configurable threshold (e.g., 60 minutes).

### 3.4.5 When

The scheduled payment reconciliation job runs.

### 3.4.6 Then

The order's status is updated to 'cancelled' with a reason of 'Payment Timeout', a high-priority alert is sent to an administrator channel (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty), and the customer is notified.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify the order status is 'cancelled', check for the admin alert, and confirm the customer notification was sent.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Job handles payment gateway API unavailability

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

An order exists in the 'payment_pending_confirmation' state.

### 3.5.5 When

The reconciliation job attempts to query the payment gateway API, but the API is down or returns a 5xx error.

### 3.5.6 Then

The job logs a critical error with the order ID and the API response, the order's status remains unchanged, the job continues to process other orders, and a system alert is triggered for the on-call team regarding the API failure.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a gateway API failure. Verify the order status is unchanged, check logs for the specific error message, and confirm that the system alert was triggered.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Job handles an invalid transaction ID not found at the gateway

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

An order exists in the 'payment_pending_confirmation' state with a transaction ID that is not recognized by the payment gateway.

### 3.6.5 When

The reconciliation job queries the payment gateway API, which returns a 'not found' error.

### 3.6.6 Then

The order's status is updated to 'cancelled' with a reason of 'Invalid Transaction', a high-priority alert is sent to an administrator for investigation, and the job logs the error.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use a fake transaction ID. Verify the order is cancelled and that an admin alert with the order details is generated.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-007

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This requirement defines the 'payment_pending_confirmation' state and the overall need for this reconciliation process.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-017

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Defines the target order states ('pending_vendor_acceptance', 'cancelled') that this job will transition orders into.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A job scheduling mechanism (e.g., Kubernetes CronJob, AWS EventBridge).
- Order Management microservice for data access.
- Payments microservice for gateway communication.
- Notification microservice for sending alerts and updates.
- Centralized logging and monitoring infrastructure (CloudWatch, Grafana).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Order records must contain a 'status' field, a 'transaction_id', and a timestamp.
- A new field, 'reconciliation_attempts', may be required on the order table to prevent infinite retries.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Availability and correctness of the Razorpay (or other payment gateway) API endpoint for querying transaction status.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The job should be able to process at least 100 pending orders per minute without significant impact on the primary database.
- API calls to the payment gateway must have a timeout of less than 5 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All communication with the payment gateway must be over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
- API keys for the payment gateway must be stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager and not in code.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Not Applicable.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Not Applicable.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Not Applicable.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires robust error handling for external API failures and network issues.
- The job must be idempotent to prevent duplicate processing if it's re-run.
- Requires careful state management and logging for auditability.
- Configuration for schedule, timeouts, and retry limits must be externalized and not hardcoded.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The payment gateway API may have rate limits that need to be handled.
- A large backlog of pending orders could cause the job to run for a long time, requiring batch processing logic.
- Potential for race conditions if an order status is updated by another process while the job is running.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Database (RDS for PostgreSQL) to query and update orders.
- Razorpay API for fetching transaction status.
- AWS SNS/SQS for triggering notifications.
- AWS CloudWatch for logging and Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.
