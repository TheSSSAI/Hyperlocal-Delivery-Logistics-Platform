# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor must be able to log in to the dashboard to access the support feature.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

ADM-024

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The backend functionality for an administrator to receive, view, and manage tickets must exist for this feature to be useful. The data models for both stories must be developed in coordination.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A new database table/collection for `support_tickets`.
- New API endpoints for creating and retrieving tickets (e.g., POST /tickets, GET /tickets).
- Integration with a notification service to alert administrators of new tickets.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the authenticated vendor's ID to associate the ticket correctly.
- May require read access to the `orders` table to validate an optional Order ID.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- API response time for ticket submission must be under 1000ms.
- API response time for loading the ticket list must be under 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All user-supplied input (subject, description, order ID) must be sanitized on the backend to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- API endpoints must be protected and enforce that a vendor can only access their own tickets (Authorization).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of creating a ticket should be intuitive and require minimal steps.
- Error messages must be clear and guide the user to correct the input.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers as per REQ-INT-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend (Vendor Dashboard) and backend (API, database) development.
- Involves creating a new data model for tickets and potentially conversations.
- Requires coordination with the development of the corresponding admin-facing feature (ADM-024).
- Implementation of a notification system for new tickets.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Scope creep: The feature could expand to include file attachments, complex status workflows, or SLA tracking. The initial implementation should be kept simple.
- Ensuring the data model is flexible enough to handle future enhancements like internal notes or replies.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Vendor authentication service (to get user ID).
- Notification service (to alert admins).
- Admin backend/dashboard (where tickets will be managed).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is tightly coupled with ADM-024 (Admin Manages Support Tickets). The backend APIs should be prioritized to unblock both frontend implementations (vendor and admin). Ideally, both stories should be planned for the same or consecutive sprints.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a foundational feature for providing vendor support and is critical for a successful platform launch and ongoing operations.
