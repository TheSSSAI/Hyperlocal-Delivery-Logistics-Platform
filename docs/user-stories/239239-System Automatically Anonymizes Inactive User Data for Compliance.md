Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A user account (of any role: Customer, Vendor, or Rider) exists with a 'last_login_timestamp' older than 24 months from the current date

### 3.1.5 And

An entry is created in the audit log (REQ-NFR-008) recording the user ID, the action ('anonymize'), and the timestamp.

### 3.1.6 When

The scheduled data anonymization job is executed

### 3.1.7 Then

The user's PII fields in the primary user table are overwritten with non-identifiable, generic placeholders (e.g., name becomes 'Inactive User', email becomes 'user_[id]@anonymized.local')

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Active user is not affected by the anonymization job

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

A user account exists with a 'last_login_timestamp' that is less than 24 months from the current date

### 3.2.5 When

The scheduled data anonymization job is executed

### 3.2.6 Then

The user's account and all associated data, including PII, remain completely unchanged.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Job runs when no inactive users are found

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

No user accounts in the database have a 'last_login_timestamp' older than 24 months

### 3.3.5 When

The scheduled data anonymization job is executed

### 3.3.6 Then

### 3.3.7 And

A log entry is created indicating the job ran and found zero users to process.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Job is idempotent and does not re-process anonymized users

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A user account already has the status 'anonymized'

### 3.4.5 When

The scheduled data anonymization job is executed again

### 3.4.6 Then

The job's query for inactive users must explicitly exclude users with the 'anonymized' status

### 3.4.7 And

The already-anonymized user's data is not modified further.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Job processes users in batches to ensure system stability

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

There are more than 1000 users who qualify for anonymization

### 3.5.5 When

The scheduled data anonymization job is executed

### 3.5.6 Then

The job must process the users in manageable batches (e.g., 100 at a time) to avoid long-running transactions and high database load

### 3.5.7 And

Each batch is committed as a separate transaction.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Job handles failures gracefully and is resumable

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

The anonymization job is processing a large set of users in batches

### 3.6.5 And

It should continue processing the remaining eligible users.

### 3.6.6 When

The job is re-run (manually or on its next schedule)

### 3.6.7 Then

It should not re-process users that were successfully anonymized before the failure

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-SYS-009-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user is defined as 'inactive' if their last recorded login was more than two years (730 days) ago.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

The scheduled job's user selection query.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Users not meeting this criterion are excluded from the process.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-SYS-009-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Anonymization must preserve the integrity of non-personal transactional data for financial auditing, as per REQ-CON-001 and REQ-NFR-007.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

The anonymization logic.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The process must only update or delete PII fields, leaving transactional records and their foreign keys intact (though the user record they point to is now anonymous).

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-002

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The user authentication system must be implemented and must reliably track a 'last_login_timestamp' for every user. This data is critical for identifying inactive users.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

REQ-NFR-008

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system-wide audit trail functionality must be in place to log all anonymization actions for compliance and security monitoring.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A job scheduling system (e.g., Kubernetes CronJob, AWS EventBridge Scheduler).
- A robust logging infrastructure (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) for job execution logs.
- A clearly defined and separated database schema for PII vs. transactional data.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Existence and accuracy of the 'last_login_timestamp' field in the user data model.
- A finalized list of all fields across all database tables that are classified as PII.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The job must be scheduled during off-peak hours (e.g., 2 AM - 4 AM IST) to minimize impact on production services.
- Database queries to find inactive users must be optimized with appropriate indexes to execute efficiently on a large user table.
- The entire job should complete within a predefined maintenance window (e.g., 1 hour).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The job must run with the minimum required database permissions (e.g., SELECT on user table, UPDATE on specific PII columns).
- Anonymized placeholder data must not contain any derivable information.
- All job execution and data modification events must be logged to an immutable audit trail.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Not Applicable.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Not Applicable.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Not Applicable.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires careful database query optimization to avoid performance degradation on a large scale.
- The logic must handle data relationships correctly to anonymize PII without breaking foreign key constraints or corrupting transactional data.
- Implementing robust, idempotent batch processing adds complexity compared to a single transaction script.
- Requires a comprehensive discovery phase to identify all PII fields across the entire application schema.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of accidental data loss or corruption if the anonymization script has bugs. Must be tested extensively against a production data snapshot.
- A poorly optimized query could cause database deadlocks or timeouts, impacting the live application.
- Incomplete identification of PII fields could leave sensitive data behind, failing the compliance objective.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Database User/Profile tables.
- System Scheduler (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS EventBridge).
- Audit Logging Service.
- Application Logging Service (CloudWatch).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Unit
- Integration
- Performance
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify that a user inactive for 25 months is correctly identified and anonymized.
- Verify that a user inactive for 23 months is ignored.
- Verify that after anonymization, associated order history is still present and correct.
- Simulate a job failure mid-batch and verify successful resumption on the next run.
- Run the job against a large-scale test database to measure execution time and database load.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A dataset with users having a wide range of 'last_login_timestamp' values (e.g., 1 month ago, 23 months ago, 25 months ago, 5 years ago).
- User accounts with and without associated transactional data (orders, reviews).
- Pre-anonymized user accounts to test for idempotency.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- The list of all PII fields being anonymized is documented in the technical specification.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a critical compliance feature but is not on the user-facing critical path for launch. It should be scheduled after the core user models and authentication are stable.
- Requires a developer with strong database and backend automation experience.
- Ample time should be allocated for thorough testing due to the destructive nature of the data modification.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

No direct impact on user-facing release features. This is a backend compliance task that can be deployed independently of the main application release cycle, but must be live to meet data retention policy deadlines.
