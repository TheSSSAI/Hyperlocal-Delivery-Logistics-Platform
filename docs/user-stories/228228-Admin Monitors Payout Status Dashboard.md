- All monetary values must be displayed with the correct currency symbol (â‚¹) and formatting.
- Timestamps should be displayed in the IST timezone (REQ-INT-005).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All filter controls and table elements must be keyboard-navigable and screen-reader accessible, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA (REQ-INT-001).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-ADM-028-01', 'rule_description': "Access to the Payout Monitoring dashboard is restricted to users with the 'Administrator' role.", 'enforcement_point': 'API Gateway and Frontend Router.', 'violation_handling': "User is redirected to a '403 Forbidden' or 'Not Authorized' page."}

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-021

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

SYS-006

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The automated rider settlement process must be implemented to generate the rider payout data that this dashboard will display.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend API requires potentially complex database queries with multiple filters, joins, and efficient pagination.
- Frontend requires building a responsive and interactive data-heavy dashboard with robust state management for filters.
- Requires careful mapping of various status codes and error messages from the external payment gateway API to a consistent internal representation.
- Database queries must be optimized with appropriate indexes on the payouts table (e.g., on date, status, recipient_id) to handle large data volumes.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation as the number of payout transactions grows. This must be mitigated with proper database indexing and query optimization.
