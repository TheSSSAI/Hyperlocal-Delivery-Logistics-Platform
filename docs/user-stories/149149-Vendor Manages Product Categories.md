# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor must be able to log in to access the dashboard where categories are managed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-005

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A store entity must exist to associate categories with a specific vendor's store.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Vendor authentication service (e.g., AWS Cognito as per REQ-NFR-003) to secure the API endpoints.
- Vendor Web Dashboard (React.js) front-end application must be set up.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a `categories` table in the PostgreSQL database with a foreign key to the `vendors` or `stores` table.
- Requires a foreign key relationship from the `products` table to the `categories` table to enforce deletion constraints.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- API response time for all category CRUD operations must be under 200ms (P95), as per REQ-NFR-001.
- The category management page on the dashboard must load in under 2.5 seconds (LCP).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All API endpoints must be protected and accessible only by authenticated users with the 'Vendor' role.
- A vendor must only be able to perform CRUD operations on their own categories. Cross-vendor access must be prevented.
- Input validation must be performed on the backend to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface for managing categories should be intuitive, requiring minimal training for a new vendor.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Vendor web dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard CRUD functionality.
- Requires a new database table and corresponding API endpoints.
- Requires a new UI component in the existing vendor dashboard.
- The logic for checking product associations before deletion is a minor complexity.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if not handled correctly (e.g., user tries to delete a category while another process assigns a product to it). Using database transactions can mitigate this.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend API Gateway to expose the new endpoints.
- Vendor authentication service for endpoint protection.
- Product management service/module will consume the list of categories.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a vendor can create, read, update, and delete a category.
- Verify a vendor cannot create a category with a duplicate name.
- Verify a vendor cannot delete a category that is in use by products.
- Verify a vendor cannot access or modify categories belonging to another vendor (authorization test).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- At least two distinct vendor accounts for testing data isolation.
- A vendor account with no categories.
- A vendor account with several categories.
- A category with no associated products.
- A category with one or more associated products.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in a staging environment.
- Backend code reviewed, approved, and merged with >80% unit test coverage.
- Frontend code reviewed, approved, and merged with >80% unit test coverage.
- E2E tests for the full CRUD lifecycle are created and passing.
- API endpoints are documented using OpenAPI specification.
- Security checks for authorization (ensuring vendors can only manage their own categories) are implemented and tested.
- UI is responsive and meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- Feature is deployed and verified in the staging environment by a QA engineer or product owner.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story for catalog management. It should be completed before stories that require assigning products to categories, such as VND-009 (Vendor Adds a New Product) and VND-013 (Vendor Bulk Imports Product Catalog).

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is critical for the initial launch, as vendors cannot effectively manage their catalogs without it.
