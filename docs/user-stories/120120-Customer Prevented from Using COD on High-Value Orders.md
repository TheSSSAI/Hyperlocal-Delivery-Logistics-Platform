A user bypasses the frontend UI and sends a direct API request to create an order with a total value of â‚¹4,000 and payment method 'COD'

### 3.6.6 Then

The backend API rejects the request with a 4xx status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

### 3.6.7 And

The API response includes an error message like 'Order value exceeds the limit for Cash on Delivery'.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

This is a critical security and business rule validation. Use an API testing tool like Postman or an integration test to verify.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Payment option selector (e.g., radio button group) for 'Cash on Delivery'.
- Informational icon (e.g., 'i') or text label next to the COD option.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The COD option should be unclickable when disabled.
- Hovering or tapping the informational icon should reveal a tooltip or message explaining the limit.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- When disabled, the COD option must be visually distinct (e.g., greyed out, reduced opacity).
- The informational message must dynamically display the current COD limit amount (e.g., '...over â‚¹2,500').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Screen readers must announce the COD option as 'disabled' when it is not available.
- The informational text explaining the limit must be accessible to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'REQ-BR-001', 'rule_description': 'The system shall enforce an administrator-configurable maximum order value for Cash on Delivery (COD) orders.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side (UI disable) and Server-side (API validation during order creation).', 'violation_handling': 'Client-side: Option is disabled. Server-side: API request is rejected with an error.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-019

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the cart summary component to provide the total order value.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-022

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story modifies the payment method selection screen defined in CUS-022.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

ADM-008

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the backend functionality for an administrator to set and store the COD limit.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A configuration service or endpoint to provide the current COD limit to both frontend and backend services.
- The Order Management microservice's order creation endpoint.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the administrator-configured COD limit value.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The check and UI update on the client-side must be visually instantaneous (<100ms) upon entering the payment screen or after a cart update.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The authoritative validation of the COD limit MUST be performed on the backend during order creation to prevent client-side manipulation.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The reason for COD being unavailable must be communicated clearly and concisely to the user at the point of selection.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The implementation must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for disabled form elements and informational text.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported mobile application versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes in both the frontend (UI logic) and backend (validation logic).
- Frontend state management needs to handle dynamic updates if the user navigates between the cart and checkout screens.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of inconsistency if the frontend and backend use different sources for the COD limit value. A single source of truth (configuration service) is essential.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Checkout Component <-> Configuration Service
- Backend Order Service <-> Configuration Service

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Verify UI state updates correctly after modifying the cart.
- Verify backend API correctly rejects orders that violate the COD limit.
- Verify the correct, dynamically-fetched limit value is displayed to the user.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Ability to configure the COD limit in the test environment.
- User accounts and product data to create carts with various total values.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Cypress for E2E tests.
