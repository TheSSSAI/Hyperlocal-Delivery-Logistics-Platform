- A final success message displayed after the process is complete.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks a button to start the process.
- User must read the informational text and explicitly confirm their intent.
- The system may require re-authentication (e.g., OTP) as a final security check before proceeding.
- Upon completion, the user is automatically logged out and returned to the login screen.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal must clearly list data to be anonymized vs. data to be retained.
- Error messages for blocking conditions (e.g., active orders) must be user-friendly and informative.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and interactive elements must have proper labels for accessibility.
- Text must have sufficient color contrast to be readable.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A customer account must exist to be deleted.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-003

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Customer must be able to log in to access their account settings.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

REQ-ARC-001

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The implementation will likely involve a Saga pattern to coordinate anonymization across multiple microservices (Identity, Order, etc.).

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User/Identity microservice for managing user state and authentication.
- Order Management microservice for checking active orders and anonymizing historical order data.
- A robust, potentially asynchronous, mechanism (e.g., using SQS) to orchestrate the anonymization across services.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the user's profile, address, and order history data across multiple databases.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Compliance with India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023, as a legal framework guiding implementation.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The initial API call to check for blocking conditions should respond in under 500ms.
- The anonymization process itself can be asynchronous but should be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 minutes).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The request must be authenticated and authorized for the logged-in user.
- A re-authentication step (e.g., OTP) is highly recommended before executing the irreversible action.
- All active sessions for the user must be terminated upon successful erasure.
- The anonymization process must be thorough, ensuring no PII is left behind in any system or log.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process must be straightforward and the language used must be clear and unambiguous to avoid user confusion.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must work consistently on all supported mobile application versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Distributed Data: User PII is spread across multiple microservices, requiring a distributed transaction or Saga pattern for consistent anonymization.
- Data Integrity: Ensuring that only PII is anonymized while preserving the integrity of transactional data for auditing is complex and critical.
- Irreversibility: The permanent nature of the action requires robust confirmation and error handling.
- Legal Precision: The implementation must precisely match the requirements of data protection laws.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Incomplete anonymization: Risk of leaving PII in unexpected places (e.g., logs, caches, other microservices).
- Saga failure: A partial failure of the anonymization process could leave data in an inconsistent state.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Identity & Access Service: To deactivate the user and invalidate tokens.
- Order Management Service: To check for active orders and anonymize PII in past orders.
- Notification Service: To potentially send a final confirmation email.
