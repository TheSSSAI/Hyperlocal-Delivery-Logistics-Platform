# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Add an available item to an empty cart

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a logged-in customer is viewing a product detail page for an item with a stock status of 'Available' or 'Limited Stock'

### 3.1.5 When

the customer taps the 'Add to Cart' button for the first time

### 3.1.6 Then

the item is added to their server-side cart with a quantity of 1, a success toast notification ('Item added to cart') is displayed for 2 seconds, and the cart icon in the app header updates to show a count of 1.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via API response and UI update. The cart state must persist if the app is closed and reopened.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Increment quantity of an item already in the cart

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a customer is viewing a product that is already in their cart with a quantity of 1

### 3.2.5 When

the customer taps the '+' button on the quantity stepper that has replaced the 'Add to Cart' button

### 3.2.6 Then

the quantity of that item in the cart is incremented to 2, and the cart's total value is recalculated.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the cart API updates the quantity correctly and the UI reflects the change. This links to CUS-017 functionality.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempt to add an 'Out of Stock' item

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

a customer is viewing a product with a stock status of 'Out of Stock'

### 3.3.5 When

the customer attempts to add the item to the cart

### 3.3.6 Then

the 'Add to Cart' button is disabled and visually distinct, and no action occurs if tapped. The item is not added to the cart.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify the button's disabled state based on the product data. This relies on REQ-FUN-005.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempt to add an item from a closed store

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

a customer is viewing a product from a vendor whose store is currently set to 'Offline'

### 3.4.5 When

the customer attempts to add the item to the cart

### 3.4.6 Then

the 'Add to Cart' button is disabled, and a message like 'This store is currently closed' is visible on the page. The item is not added to the cart.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify the button's disabled state based on the vendor's status from the API. This relies on REQ-FUN-012.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Network failure when adding an item

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

a customer is viewing an available product and their device has no internet connectivity

### 3.5.5 When

the customer taps the 'Add to Cart' button

### 3.5.6 Then

the app displays a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'No internet connection'), the item is not added to the cart, and the app state remains stable.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Test by disabling network on the client device. The app should not crash.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Backend API failure when adding an item

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

a customer taps the 'Add to Cart' button for an available item

### 3.6.5 When

the backend API returns a 5xx server error

### 3.6.6 Then

the app displays a generic error message (e.g., 'Something went wrong. Please try again.'), the item is not added to the cart, and the cart's state on the client remains unchanged.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use a mock server or tool like Postman to simulate a server error response.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An 'Add to Cart' button on product list items and product detail pages.
- A quantity stepper control ('-', quantity, '+') which replaces the 'Add to Cart' button once an item is in the cart.
- A cart icon in the main application header.
- A badge on the cart icon displaying the total number of items.
- A non-modal toast/snackbar notification for feedback.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping 'Add to Cart' adds the item and changes the button to a quantity stepper starting at '1'.
- Tapping '+' on the stepper increments the quantity.
- Tapping '-' on the stepper decrements the quantity (covered in CUS-017/CUS-018).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The button must be clearly disabled (e.g., greyed out) for unavailable items or closed stores.
- The cart badge count must update in real-time upon adding an item.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons ('Add to Cart', '+', '-') must have accessible labels for screen readers (e.g., 'Add [Product Name] to cart').
- Touch targets must meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines for size.
- Feedback notifications must be announced by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-CART-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A customer cannot add an item to the cart if its stock quantity is zero.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Server-side, upon receiving the 'add to cart' API request, after a real-time inventory check.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API will return a '409 Conflict' or similar error with a message 'Item is out of stock'. The client will display this to the user.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-CART-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A customer cannot add an item to the cart if the vendor's store is offline.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side (UI disable) and Server-side (API validation).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The API will return an error indicating the store is closed. The client UI should prevent the action proactively.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-003

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be authenticated to have a persistent, user-specific cart.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-011

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User must be able to find/view a product before they can add it to the cart.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

CUS-014

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The UI and logic depend on the product's stock status being available.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

VND-007

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The system needs to know the vendor's online/offline status to enable/disable cart actions.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A 'Cart' microservice or module responsible for managing cart state.
- A 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice to provide real-time product and stock information.
- Client-side state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit) to manage the cart state globally in the app.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the product catalog with real-time inventory counts.
- Access to vendor profiles to check for store availability status.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The P95 latency for the 'add to cart' API call must be under 200ms, as per REQ-NFR-001.
- The UI update (button state change, cart badge update) must feel instantaneous (<100ms) to the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The 'add to cart' API endpoint must be authenticated and authorized to ensure a user can only modify their own cart.
- Server-side validation must be performed on the product ID and quantity to prevent malicious data submission.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action must be simple and require only a single tap.
- Immediate and clear visual feedback must be provided upon success or failure.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires real-time, atomic inventory checks to prevent race conditions.
- Client-side state management needs to be robust to ensure UI consistency across different screens.
- Backend cart logic must handle persistence between sessions.
- Designing the API to be idempotent for 'add' actions can prevent issues with network retries.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Latency in the inventory check API could slow down the user experience.
- Potential for inconsistency between client-side cart state and server-side state if not managed carefully.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client -> Cart Service API
- Cart Service -> Vendor & Catalog Service (for product price and stock validation)
