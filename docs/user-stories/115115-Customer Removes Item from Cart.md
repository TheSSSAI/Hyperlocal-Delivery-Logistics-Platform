# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

CUS-018-AC-01

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Remove an item from a cart with multiple items

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a customer is viewing their cart which contains at least two different items

### 3.1.5 When

the customer taps the 'Remove' control for one of the items

### 3.1.6 Then

the selected item is immediately removed from the cart's item list, and the other items remain

### 3.1.7 And

the cart's subtotal, taxes, delivery fee, and final total are recalculated and updated on the screen without a full page reload.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify via E2E test that the correct item is removed and all financial values in the cart summary are recalculated correctly. Check API response for the updated cart state.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

CUS-018-AC-02

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Remove the last item from the cart

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

a customer is viewing their cart which contains only one item

### 3.2.5 When

the customer taps the 'Remove' control for that item

### 3.2.6 Then

the cart transitions to an 'empty' state

### 3.2.7 And

all cart totals (subtotal, taxes, fees, total) are displayed as â‚¹0.00.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Verify that the UI displays the empty cart component. The 'Proceed to Checkout' button should be disabled or hidden.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

CUS-018-AC-03

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempt to remove an item with a network failure

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

a customer is viewing their cart and has an unstable network connection

### 3.3.5 When

the customer taps the 'Remove' control and the API call fails

### 3.3.6 Then

the item remains visible in the cart

### 3.3.7 And

a non-disruptive error message is displayed to the user (e.g., 'Failed to remove item. Please check your connection and try again.').

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Use browser/app developer tools to simulate network failure and verify that the UI state remains consistent and an appropriate error message is shown.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

CUS-018-AC-04

### 3.4.2 Scenario

API idempotency for remove action

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

a customer is viewing their cart

### 3.4.5 When

the customer rapidly taps the 'Remove' control for the same item multiple times

### 3.4.6 Then

the system processes only the first valid request to remove the item

### 3.4.7 And

subsequent requests for the same removal action do not result in an error and the cart state remains consistent.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Backend API test: send multiple DELETE requests for the same cart item ID. The first should return a 200/204 with the updated cart, and subsequent ones should return a success (e.g., 200/204) or a 404 Not Found, but not a 500 server error.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A distinct and easily tappable 'Remove' icon (e.g., trash can) or text link associated with each line item in the cart.
- An empty cart view component with a message and potentially a call-to-action (e.g., 'Continue Shopping' button).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Remove' control triggers the item removal and cart update.
- The cart totals must update in real-time without requiring a manual refresh or screen navigation.
- A subtle visual feedback (e.g., fade-out animation) should confirm the removal action.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The cart must always display the correctly calculated subtotal, taxes, delivery fees, and final total.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Remove' control must have a descriptive ARIA label, such as 'Remove [Item Name] from cart'.
- Changes to the cart total must be announced by screen readers to inform visually impaired users of the update.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

*No items available*

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-016

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to add an item to the cart must exist before an item can be removed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-019

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The cart summary view, which contains the list of items and totals, must be implemented as the location for this functionality.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (e.g., in the 'Order Management' microservice) to handle item removal from a user's cart session.
- Frontend state management solution (e.g., Redux Toolkit, React Query) to manage cart state reactively.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the current user's cart data, including item details and prices.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response for removing an item and returning the updated cart state should be under 500ms (P95).
- The UI update on the client device should appear instantaneous to the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for cart modification must be authenticated and authorized, ensuring a user can only modify their own cart.
- The system must prevent parameter tampering (e.g., a user attempting to modify another user's cart).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The remove action should be intuitive and require minimal user effort.
- The system's response (item removed, totals updated) must be immediate and clear.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for interactive elements and dynamic content updates.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported mobile OS versions (iOS/Android).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard CRUD operation.
- Requires careful frontend state management to ensure UI consistency.
- Backend recalculation logic must be accurate and handle all pricing rules.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if multiple cart operations (e.g., update quantity, remove item) are performed in quick succession. Optimistic UI updates should have a rollback mechanism.
- Inconsistent state between client and server if network requests fail. The client state must reliably sync with the server's source of truth.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Cart Component -> Backend Cart/Order Service API

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Remove one item from a multi-item cart.
- Remove the only item from a cart.
- Attempt to remove an item with network disconnected.
- Verify accessibility labels and screen reader announcements for the remove action and total updates.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- User accounts with pre-populated carts (one item, multiple items).
- Items with different pricing to verify calculation logic.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest & React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Cypress for End-to-End testing.
- Postman or similar for API-level testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one peer
- Unit and integration tests implemented with >80% coverage for new code
- E2E test case automated and passing in the test suite
- User interface reviewed and approved by UX/Product Owner
- Performance requirements (API latency) verified
- Security requirements (authorization) validated at the API level
- Accessibility checks completed and passed
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational feature for the cart. It should be prioritized early in the development of the ordering flow.
- Can be developed in parallel with other cart management stories like 'Update Item Quantity' (CUS-017).

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

Critical for Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch. A user cannot be expected to complete an order without the ability to correct their cart.
