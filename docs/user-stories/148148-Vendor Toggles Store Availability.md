### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a vendor is logged into the vendor dashboard and their store status is 'Online'

### 3.2.5 When

the vendor activates the 'Go Online' master switch

### 3.2.6 Then

the system updates the store's availability status to 'Online' in the database, the UI of the switch visually changes to reflect the 'Online' state, a success notification ('Your store is now online') is displayed, and the store is listed as available for new orders in the customer-facing application (subject to business hours).

the vendor attempts to toggle the store availability switch and the backend API call fails

### 3.5.6 Then

the switch UI reverts to its original state, and a user-friendly error message is displayed (e.g., 'Failed to update store status. Please check your connection and try again.').

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Interaction with scheduled business hours

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

a vendor's store is outside of its configured daily business hours

### 3.6.5 When

the vendor toggles the master switch to 'Online'

### 3.6.6 Then

the store's master availability status is set to 'Online' in the system, but it will only become available for customer orders once the scheduled business hours begin.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Set business hours to a future time. Toggle switch to 'Online'. As a customer, verify the store shows as 'Opens at [time]' and is not orderable. After the opening time passes, verify it becomes orderable without further vendor action.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A prominent toggle switch on the main vendor dashboard, clearly labeled with the current status (e.g., 'Store is Online' / 'Store is Offline').
- A confirmation modal dialog that appears when toggling the store to 'Offline', with 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' actions.
- Toast notifications for success and error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- A single click/tap on the toggle switch initiates the state change.
- The confirmation modal for going offline prevents accidental changes.
- The switch should provide immediate visual feedback upon a successful state change.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The current state ('Online' or 'Offline') must be unambiguous.
- The switch should be one of the first things a vendor sees upon logging in.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The toggle switch must be keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `role='switch'`, `aria-checked`).
- Color changes must be accompanied by text labels to indicate status for color-blind users, compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-VND-AVAIL-01', 'rule_description': "A store's orderability is determined by two conditions: the master availability switch must be 'Online' AND the current time must be within the vendor's configured business hours.", 'enforcement_point': 'Order Management Service, before allowing a customer to add items to a cart or place an order.', 'violation_handling': 'The customer is prevented from placing an order. The UI in the customer app will show the store as closed or unavailable.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor must be able to log in to access the dashboard where this switch will be located.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-005

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A store profile entity must exist in the database with a status attribute that can be toggled.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

VND-006

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The system needs defined business hours to correctly determine final store availability, as per BR-VND-AVAIL-01.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- An API endpoint in the 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice to update the store's availability status.
- A mechanism (e.g., event publishing via SQS/SNS) to notify other services (like Search and Order Management) of the status change to ensure system-wide consistency and cache invalidation.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a field in the `vendors` or `stores` database table to persist the availability state (e.g., `availability_status` ENUM('ONLINE', 'OFFLINE')).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API call to update the store status must have a P95 latency of under 500ms.
- The status change must be reflected in the customer-facing application within 30 seconds to minimize the window where a customer could order from a newly-closed store.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for changing store status must be secured and only accessible by an authenticated vendor user who owns that specific store.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must prevent other user roles from accessing this functionality.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The switch must be highly visible and intuitive to use, requiring no special training.
- Feedback (success/error) must be immediate and clear.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor web dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity is ensuring the state change is propagated reliably and quickly across a distributed microservices architecture.
- Cache invalidation for vendor/store data is critical. When a store goes offline, any cached lists of available vendors must be updated or invalidated promptly.
- Requires coordination between the Vendor service (owning the state), the Search/Discovery service (displaying vendors), and the Order service (validating orders).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Race conditions: A customer could fetch a list of available stores just before one goes offline, and then attempt to place an order. The final check in the Order service is the ultimate safeguard against this.
- Eventual consistency: A delay in propagating the 'Offline' status could lead to a poor customer experience. The 30-second performance NFR is designed to mitigate this.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Vendor & Catalog Service: Owns the API and database field for store status.
- Order Management Service: Must check the store's status before creating a new order.
- Search/Discovery Service: Must filter out offline stores from customer search results.
- API Gateway: Routes the request from the vendor dashboard to the correct service.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Vendor toggles store offline and verifies it's unavailable in the customer app.
- Vendor toggles store online and verifies it's available in the customer app.
- Attempt to place an order from a store that was just toggled offline.
- Verify behavior when toggling online outside of business hours.
- Test API failure and ensure the UI handles the error correctly.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test vendor account with a created store.
- A test customer account to verify the public-facing changes.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest and React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Jest for backend unit/integration tests.
- Cypress for End-to-End (E2E) testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria are validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit and integration tests are written and achieve >80% code coverage.
- E2E tests for the primary scenarios are automated and passing.
- The UI has been reviewed by a UX designer and approved.
- Performance NFRs (API latency, propagation time) have been verified.
- API documentation (OpenAPI) for the new endpoint is complete.
- The feature has been successfully deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational feature for vendor operations. It should be prioritized early in the development of the vendor module.
- Requires cross-team coordination if different teams are responsible for the vendor dashboard, customer app, and backend services.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This feature is critical for a successful pilot launch. Without it, vendors have no way to manage real-time operational issues, which would lead to high cancellation rates and a poor user experience for all parties.
