# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Vendor rejects a prepaid order

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a vendor is logged into the vendor dashboard and is viewing a new prepaid order with status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'

### 3.1.5 When

the vendor clicks the 'Reject' button and confirms the rejection in the confirmation dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

the order's status is updated to 'Cancelled' in the system, the order is removed from the vendor's 'New Orders' queue, a notification is sent to the customer informing them of the rejection, a full refund is automatically initiated for the customer, and the rejection event is logged for vendor performance analysis.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via API that order status is 'Cancelled'. Verify the customer receives a push notification. Verify a refund transaction is created in the payment service. Verify the order no longer appears in the vendor's new order list. Verify the rejection is recorded in the vendor's performance log.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Vendor rejects a Cash on Delivery (COD) order

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a vendor is logged into the vendor dashboard and is viewing a new COD order with status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'

### 3.2.5 When

the vendor clicks the 'Reject' button and confirms the rejection

### 3.2.6 Then

the order's status is updated to 'Cancelled', the order is removed from the 'New Orders' queue, a notification is sent to the customer, and no refund process is initiated.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no refund transaction is created in the payment service, as it was a COD order.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Alternative Flow: Vendor cancels the rejection action

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

a vendor has clicked the 'Reject' button and a confirmation dialog is displayed

### 3.3.5 When

the vendor clicks the 'Cancel' button in the dialog

### 3.3.6 Then

the dialog closes and the order remains in the 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' state with no changes.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify the order status remains unchanged and the order is still visible in the new orders queue.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Order is cancelled by the customer while vendor is viewing

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a vendor is viewing an order in the 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' state

### 3.4.5 When

the order is cancelled by the customer or the system (e.g., timeout)

### 3.4.6 Then

the vendor's UI updates in real-time to show the order is cancelled, and the 'Accept' and 'Reject' buttons are disabled or removed.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

This requires WebSocket or similar real-time updates to the vendor dashboard.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Backend API fails during rejection

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a vendor clicks 'Reject' and confirms the action

### 3.5.5 When

the backend API call to update the order status fails

### 3.5.6 Then

the vendor dashboard displays a non-intrusive error message (e.g., 'Failed to reject order. Please try again.'), and the order remains in its original state.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a 5xx server error on the reject endpoint and verify the UI response and that the order status is not changed.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Reject' button on each new order card/view.
- A confirmation modal/dialog with a clear warning message (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to reject this order? This action cannot be undone.'), a 'Confirm Reject' button, and a 'Cancel' button.
- A toast notification or similar feedback mechanism to confirm successful rejection.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Reject' opens the confirmation modal.
- Clicking 'Confirm Reject' triggers the rejection workflow and closes the modal.
- Clicking 'Cancel' in the modal closes it with no action taken.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The rejected order must be immediately removed from the list of active/new orders.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and dialogs must be keyboard-navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers, compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

An order can only be rejected if it is in the 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' state.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Order Management Service)

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API will return a 409 Conflict (or similar) error if an attempt is made to reject an order in an invalid state.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

All manual and automatic order rejections must be logged for vendor performance analysis, as per REQ-FUN-010.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Logic (Order Management Service)

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

A failure to log the event should trigger a high-priority monitoring alert, but should not block the core rejection workflow.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-016

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the vendor dashboard to display incoming new orders before a reject action can be taken.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-017

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Reject' button will be part of the same UI component as the 'Accept' button, making them logically dependent.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Order Management Service: Must expose a secure, idempotent endpoint to update an order's status to 'Cancelled'.
- Notification Service: Must be able to send a templated notification to a specific customer upon receiving an event.
- Payments & Settlements Service: Must expose an endpoint to initiate a full refund for a given order ID.
- Real-time communication channel (e.g., WebSockets via Socket.IO) for updating the vendor dashboard.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The system must be able to distinguish between prepaid and COD orders to correctly trigger (or skip) the refund process.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the reject action must be under 500ms (P95).
- The subsequent asynchronous events (notification, refund initiation) should be triggered within 2 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and ensure the authenticated user (vendor) has permission to modify the specific order.
- The system must prevent race conditions where an order could be actioned by both the customer and vendor simultaneously.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The rejection process must be simple and require no more than two clicks (Reject -> Confirm).
- Error messages must be clear and actionable.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor web dashboard must be fully functional on all modern web browsers supported by the platform.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordination across multiple microservices (Order, Payments, Notifications).
- Implementing a robust Saga pattern for the distributed transaction adds complexity.
- Real-time UI updates to handle edge cases (e.g., simultaneous customer cancellation) require a WebSocket implementation.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for failure in one of the downstream services (e.g., refund service fails). The system must handle this gracefully, likely by logging the failure for manual intervention.
- Ensuring idempotency of the reject endpoint is critical to prevent duplicate processing on network retries.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Vendor Dashboard (Frontend) -> API Gateway
- API Gateway -> Order Management Service
- Order Management Service -> Notification Service (via message bus)
- Order Management Service -> Payments & Settlements Service (via message bus)

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify rejection of a prepaid order triggers a refund.
- Verify rejection of a COD order does not trigger a refund.
- Verify the customer receives a notification.
- Verify the UI updates correctly after rejection.
- Simulate an API failure and verify the UI shows an error.
- Test the race condition where a customer cancels at the same time the vendor rejects.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs
