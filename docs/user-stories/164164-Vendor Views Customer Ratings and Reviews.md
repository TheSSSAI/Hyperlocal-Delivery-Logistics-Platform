# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend: Implementing efficient database queries for combined filtering, sorting, and pagination.

- Data Privacy: Implementing the customer name anonymization logic correctly in the API layer.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Inefficient database queries could lead to slow API response times as the number of reviews grows.
- Incorrect implementation of access control could lead to a data leak, allowing vendors to see reviews for other stores.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points
