the Onboarding Team member has a vendor spreadsheet (.CSV or .XLSX) with all required columns (e.g., product_name, price, stock_quantity) and correctly formatted data

### 3.1.5 When

they execute the transformation script, providing the path to the input file

### 3.1.6 Then

the script generates a new CSV file named '[original_filename]_clean.csv' that is perfectly formatted for the bulk import feature, and a second file named '[original_filename]_errors.csv' is created but is empty except for its header row, and a success message is displayed in the console indicating 'X rows processed successfully, 0 rows failed'.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the output CSV matches the schema defined in REQ-FUN-011. Verify the error CSV is empty. Verify the console output is accurate.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.4 Given

a vendor spreadsheet contains a row where the 'price' column has a non-numeric value (e.g., 'TBD')

### 3.2.5 When

the transformation script is executed

### 3.2.6 Then

the clean output CSV is generated containing all valid rows, the invalid row is excluded from the clean CSV, and the error CSV contains an entry for the failed row specifying the row number and a clear error message like 'Invalid data type for column [price]: expected a number but found [TBD]'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Check that the clean CSV does not contain the invalid row. Check that the error CSV contains the correct row number and a descriptive error message.

Automatic data cleaning (trimming whitespace)

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

a vendor spreadsheet has data with leading or trailing whitespace (e.g., '  Product A  ')

### 3.5.5 When

the transformation script is executed

### 3.5.6 Then

the script successfully processes the row, and the corresponding value in the clean output CSV is trimmed of all extraneous whitespace (e.g., 'Product A').

### 3.7.4 Given

a vendor spreadsheet is provided that is completely empty or contains only a header row

### 3.7.5 When

the transformation script is executed

### 3.7.6 Then

the script completes without errors, generates an empty clean CSV and an empty error CSV, and displays a message in the console like 'Processing complete. No data rows found to process.'

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Verify that both output files are created but contain no data rows.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Not applicable (CLI tool)

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User executes the script from a command line terminal.
- User provides the input file path as a command-line argument.
- User can optionally provide an output directory path as an argument.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Console output must clearly indicate the start and end of the script execution.
- Console output must provide a summary of results: number of rows succeeded, number of rows failed.
- All error messages (fatal or row-specific) must be clear, specific, and actionable for a non-technical user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Not applicable (CLI tool)

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-TRN-001', 'rule_description': 'The script must validate input data against the schema required by the bulk import feature (REQ-FUN-011), including required fields, data types, and value constraints.', 'enforcement_point': 'During script execution, on a row-by-row basis.', 'violation_handling': 'Rows that violate the rules are skipped and logged to the error report file. If the file structure itself is invalid (e.g., missing columns), the script fails entirely.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'VND-013', 'dependency_reason': 'The target schema (column names, data types, validation rules) for this transformation script is defined by the requirements of the bulk import functionality. This story cannot be completed until that schema is finalized.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A stable version of a scripting runtime (e.g., Python 3.8+ or Node.js v18+) must be available in the execution environment.
- Libraries for parsing spreadsheet files (e.g., pandas/openpyxl for Python, xlsx for Node.js).

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- A finalized and documented data schema for the vendor product catalog is required.
- Sample vendor spreadsheets (both clean and with errors) are needed for development and testing.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- None

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The script must process a spreadsheet containing 1,000 product rows in under 30 seconds on a standard business laptop.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The script must not execute any macros or embedded code within the spreadsheets.
- The script should only have read access to the input file and write access to the designated output directory.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The script must be runnable with a single command.
- A comprehensive README.md file must be provided, detailing installation, dependencies, command usage, expected input format, and examples of error messages.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Not applicable (CLI tool)

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The script must be compatible with both .CSV (UTF-8 encoded) and .XLSX file formats.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires robust error handling for a wide variety of potential data quality issues.
- Needs to handle two different file formats (CSV and XLSX).
- The validation logic should be configuration-driven (e.g., from a JSON or YAML file) to allow for easy updates to the schema without changing the script's code.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Vendor spreadsheets may have inconsistent column naming, requiring a flexible mapping configuration.
- Character encoding issues in CSV files could lead to parsing errors.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The primary integration point is the output CSV file, which must be consumed by the bulk import feature (VND-013).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Test with an empty file and a header-only file.
- Test with a file containing special characters and different languages to check encoding handling.
- Test with a large file (1000+ rows) to verify performance requirements.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A suite of sample .CSV and .XLSX files covering all test scenarios is required.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools
