### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful payout for an eligible vendor with a positive balance

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A vendor has completed orders totaling ₹10,000 within the defined weekly settlement period, has a 15% commission rate, and has valid, verified bank details on file.

### 3.1.5 When

The weekly vendor payout job is triggered.

### 3.1.6 Then

The system correctly calculates the net payout as ₹8,500 (₹10,000 gross - ₹1,500 commission).

### 3.1.7 And

An immutable audit log entry is created detailing the payout attempt, including amounts, vendor ID, and the transaction ID from the payment gateway.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify the payout record in the admin dashboard and the transaction log in the RazorpayX test environment.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Vendor with zero or negative balance is skipped

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

A vendor has no completed orders or has a negative balance due to refunds/adjustments in the settlement period.

### 3.2.5 When

The weekly vendor payout job is triggered.

### 3.2.6 Then

The system calculates a net payout of ₹0 or less.

### 3.2.7 And

The system logs that the vendor was skipped due to an insufficient balance, and the negative balance is carried forward.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Check the job logs to confirm the vendor was correctly identified and skipped. Verify no payout transaction was created.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Payout fails due to external API error

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A vendor is eligible for a payout.

### 3.3.5 When

The system calls the RazorpayX API, and the API returns a server-side error (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable).

### 3.3.6 Then

The system records the payout attempt as 'failed' and stores the error reason from the API response.

### 3.3.7 And

A high-priority alert is triggered for an administrator to investigate the API outage.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Mock the API to return a 5xx error. Verify the payout status is 'failed' in the database and an alert is generated in the monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager).

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Payout fails due to invalid vendor bank details

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A vendor is eligible for a payout but has provided incorrect bank account details.

### 3.4.5 When

The system initiates the payout, and the RazorpayX API rejects it due to invalid beneficiary details.

### 3.4.6 Then

The system records the payout as 'failed' and stores the specific reason (e.g., 'Invalid IFSC code').

### 3.4.7 And

An alert is created for the administrator to follow up.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Use test credentials known to fail for invalid beneficiary details. Verify the 'failed' status and check that the vendor notification was sent.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Payout job is idempotent

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

The weekly payout job runs and successfully processes a payout for Vendor A, but then the job crashes before completing for all other vendors.

### 3.5.5 When

The payout job is re-run for the same settlement period.

### 3.5.6 Then

The system correctly identifies that Vendor A has already been successfully paid (or a payout is already in a 'processing' state).

### 3.5.7 And

The system continues processing payouts for the remaining vendors who were not paid.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Manually trigger the job, stop it mid-process, and re-trigger it. Verify in the logs and payout gateway that no duplicate transactions were created.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Payout calculation respects custom commission rates

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.6.4 Given

A vendor has a custom commission rate of 10% configured, overriding the 15% default.

### 3.6.5 And

The system initiates a payout for ₹9,000.

### 3.6.6 When

The weekly vendor payout job is triggered.

### 3.6.7 Then

The system correctly applies the 10% rate and calculates the net payout as ₹9,000.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Configure a custom commission rate for a test vendor and verify the calculation in the job's output log.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

13

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a high-complexity, critical-path story that depends on several other foundational features. It should be scheduled after the core order and vendor management systems are stable.
- Requires a senior backend engineer due to the financial and distributed systems complexity.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This feature is essential for platform launch. Without automated payouts, the business model is not scalable.
