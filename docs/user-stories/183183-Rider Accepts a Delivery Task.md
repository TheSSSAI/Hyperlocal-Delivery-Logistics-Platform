# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

RDR-012-AC-01

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Rider accepts a valid task offer within the time limit

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a Rider is logged in, 'Online', and has received a delivery task offer with a 60-second acceptance timer

### 3.1.5 When

the Rider taps the 'Accept' button before the timer expires

### 3.1.6 Then

the system must assign the order to this Rider, the order status must be updated to 'Accepted', the Rider's status must be updated to 'On Task', the Rider's app UI must transition to the 'Navigate to Vendor' screen, and the Customer must receive a notification that a rider has been assigned.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via API response, database state change for both order and rider records, and observing the UI transition and push notification on a test customer device.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

RDR-012-AC-02

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Rider attempts to accept an expired task offer

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

a Rider has received a delivery task offer

### 3.2.5 When

the Rider taps the 'Accept' button after the acceptance timer has expired

### 3.2.6 Then

the app must display a non-blocking error message (e.g., 'This offer has expired'), the task offer screen must be dismissed, and the Rider's status must remain 'Online'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Simulate timer expiration and verify the API rejects the request with an appropriate error code (e.g., 410 Gone) and the UI handles it gracefully.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

RDR-012-AC-03

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Rider attempts to accept a task already taken by another rider

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

a Rider has received a delivery task offer that was broadcast to multiple riders

### 3.3.5 When

the Rider taps the 'Accept' button, but another rider has already accepted it

### 3.3.6 Then

the app must display an error message (e.g., 'This order has already been assigned'), the task offer screen must be dismissed, and the Rider's status must remain 'Online'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Requires a test script to simulate two riders accepting the same offer simultaneously. Verify the API returns a conflict error (e.g., 409 Conflict) to the second rider.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

RDR-012-AC-04

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Rider attempts to accept an order that was cancelled

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

a Rider has received a delivery task offer

### 3.4.5 When

the Rider taps the 'Accept' button, but the underlying order has been cancelled by a Customer or Admin

### 3.4.6 Then

the app must display a message (e.g., 'This order has been cancelled'), the task offer screen must be dismissed, and the Rider's status must remain 'Online'.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

In a test environment, cancel an order after it has been offered to a rider but before acceptance. Verify the API rejects the acceptance attempt.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

RDR-012-AC-05

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Network failure during task acceptance

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

a Rider taps the 'Accept' button

### 3.5.5 When

the API call to the backend fails due to a network error on the client side

### 3.5.6 Then

the app must display a clear network error message and should implement a single, automatic retry with a short timeout. If the retry fails, the app must revert to its previous state.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Use network throttling tools to simulate a connection loss after the 'Accept' button is tapped. Verify the UI response and the idempotency of the backend endpoint.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A prominent 'Accept' button on the task offer screen.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Accept' button triggers the acceptance logic.
- Upon successful acceptance, the task offer screen must be replaced by the 'Navigate to Vendor' screen.
- A brief loading indicator should be shown while the acceptance is being processed to provide immediate feedback.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The 'Navigate to Vendor' screen must display the vendor's name, address, and relevant order details.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Accept' button must have a sufficient tap target size and contrast ratio, compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'RDR-BR-001', 'rule_description': "A rider can only accept a task if their status is 'Online' and they are not currently assigned to another active task.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API (Rider Logistics Service) before processing the acceptance request.', 'violation_handling': 'The API request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden or 409 Conflict error code, and the client app displays an appropriate message.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

RDR-010

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The rider must receive a new task offer before they can accept it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

RDR-011

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The UI screen on which the 'Accept' button exists is defined in this story.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

RDR-014

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story defines the screen and functionality that the user transitions to immediately after successful acceptance.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Rider Logistics microservice for managing rider state and task assignment.
- Order Management microservice for updating the order status.
- Message Bus (AWS SQS/SNS) for asynchronous communication between services (e.g., publishing an 'OrderAssigned' event).
- Notification Service (FCM) to send push notifications to the customer.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A valid, unassigned order record in the 'Ready for Pickup' state.
- A valid, 'Online' rider record.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The P95 latency for the 'Accept Task' API endpoint must be under 200ms, as per REQ-NFR-001.
- The client-side transition from tapping 'Accept' to seeing the 'Navigate to Vendor' screen must complete in under 1.5 seconds on a stable 4G connection.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be authenticated via JWT and authorized to ensure only the rider to whom the task was offered can accept it.
- The system must prevent race conditions where two riders could be assigned the same order. This requires atomic operations on the order record.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action must be achievable with a single tap.
- Feedback to the rider (success, failure, loading) must be immediate and clear.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Must function correctly on supported versions of iOS and Android.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a distributed transaction (Saga pattern) to ensure data consistency across the Rider Logistics and Order Management services.
- Backend logic must robustly handle race conditions when multiple riders attempt to accept the same task.
- The API endpoint must be idempotent to safely handle client-side retries on network failure.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for data inconsistency between microservices if the Saga pattern is not implemented correctly.
- Performance degradation under high load if the race condition handling (e.g., database locking) is not optimized.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Rider Mobile App -> API Gateway -> Rider Logistics Service
- Rider Logistics Service -> Message Bus -> Order Management Service
- Rider Logistics Service -> Message Bus -> Notification Service
