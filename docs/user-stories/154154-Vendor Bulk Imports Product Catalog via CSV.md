# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated 'Import Products' button on the main product management page.
- A modal or dedicated page for the import process.
- A clear file upload zone (e.g., file input or drag-and-drop area).
- A prominent, clickable link to 'Download CSV Template'.
- A status display area for feedback during and after processing (e.g., 'Uploading...', 'Processing...', 'Complete').
- A clickable link to 'Download Error Report' that appears only when there are failures.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks 'Import Products' to open the import interface.
- User clicks 'Download Template' to get the required CSV format.
- User selects a .csv file from their computer or drags it onto the upload zone.
- The system provides immediate feedback on file selection (e.g., file name displayed) and validation (e.g., wrong file type error).
- The import process runs in the background, allowing the user to potentially navigate away.
- A persistent notification or status update on the dashboard informs the user of completion.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Clear instructions on the required CSV format and mandatory fields.
- Real-time feedback on the state of the upload and processing.
- A final summary message detailing the number of successful creations, updates, and failures.
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The file upload input must be keyboard accessible and have a proper label.
- All links and buttons must have accessible names.
- Status updates and error messages must be conveyed to screen readers using ARIA live regions.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-IMP-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The 'product_sku' must be unique per vendor. If a SKU in the CSV already exists for that vendor, the existing product record will be updated. Otherwise, a new product will be created.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

During CSV row processing by the backend worker.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

This is not a violation but a defined behavior (update vs. create).

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-IMP-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The following columns are mandatory and cannot be empty: 'product_sku', 'product_name', 'price', 'stock_quantity', 'category_name'.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

During CSV row validation.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The row fails validation. It is included in the error report with a message like 'Required field [field_name] is missing'.

## 5.3.0 Rule Id

### 5.3.1 Rule Id

BR-IMP-003

### 5.3.2 Rule Description

'price' must be a positive number. 'stock_quantity' must be a non-negative integer (0 is allowed).

### 5.3.3 Enforcement Point

During CSV row validation.

### 5.3.4 Violation Handling

The row fails validation. It is included in the error report with a message like 'Invalid data format for [field_name]'.

## 5.4.0 Rule Id

### 5.4.1 Rule Id

BR-IMP-004

### 5.4.2 Rule Description

The 'category_name' provided in the CSV must match an existing category for that vendor.

### 5.4.3 Enforcement Point

During CSV row validation.

### 5.4.4 Violation Handling

The row fails validation. It is included in the error report with a message: 'Category "[category_name]" does not exist. Please create it first.'

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The core logic for creating a single product, including its data model and validation, must exist before a bulk creation mechanism can be built upon it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-008

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system for managing product categories must be in place, as the import process needs to associate products with existing categories.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A background job processing system (e.g., AWS SQS with Lambda, or NestJS with BullMQ).
- Cloud storage for temporary file uploads (e.g., Amazon S3).
- A robust server-side CSV parsing library.
- API endpoints for file upload initiation and status checking.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the vendor's existing product catalog to check for duplicate SKUs.
- Access to the vendor's list of categories for validation.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The file upload API response time should be under 500ms.
- The asynchronous processing of a CSV with 1,000 rows should complete in under 2 minutes.
- The UI must remain responsive during file upload and processing.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All uploaded files must be stored in a secure, non-public S3 bucket.
- Uploaded files should be scanned for malware before processing.
- The CSV parsing logic must be hardened against injection attacks (e.g., CSV formula injection).
- The feature must respect vendor authorization; a vendor can only import products for their own store.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process must be intuitive for non-technical users.
- Error messages and reports must be clear and help the user correct their file.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as stated in REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The web dashboard feature must be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires asynchronous processing architecture (queues, workers).
- Complex validation logic for multiple fields and business rules per row.
- Implementation of a detailed, downloadable error report.
- Handling of file uploads, storage, and security.
- Requires a robust transaction management strategy to handle partial failures (i.e., valid rows should be committed even if others fail).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation when processing very large files (e.g., >10,000 rows).
- Potential for race conditions or data inconsistency if transaction management is not handled correctly.
- Character encoding issues with CSV files created on different operating systems.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Vendor Dashboard.
- Backend Product/Catalog Service.
- Background Job Queue Service.
- Cloud Storage Service (S3).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Upload a CSV with invalid headers.
- Attempt to upload a non-CSV file.
- Upload an empty CSV.
- Test with a large CSV (e.g., 5,000 rows) to check performance.
- Test CSVs with special characters, quotes, and different encodings.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of pre-defined CSV files covering all test scenarios.
- A test vendor account with existing products and categories.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for unit/integration tests.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- The API contract between the frontend and backend for file upload and status polling must be defined early in the sprint.
- The exact format and required headers for the CSV template must be finalized before development begins.
- Requires infrastructure setup for the background job queue and S3 bucket permissions.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a significant feature for vendor onboarding and satisfaction. It should be highlighted in release notes and vendor communications.
