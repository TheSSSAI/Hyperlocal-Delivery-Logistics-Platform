# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Vendor successfully accepts an order

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a vendor is logged into their dashboard and is viewing a new order with the status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'

### 3.1.5 When

the vendor clicks the 'Accept' button for that order, is prompted to select an 'Estimated Preparation Time' from a list, selects a valid time (e.g., '15-20 min'), and confirms the action

### 3.1.6 Then

the system updates the order status to 'Preparing', the order event log is updated with this state change, a notification is triggered to the customer with the updated ETA based on the selected time, and the vendor dashboard UI updates to show the order's new status and removes the 'Accept'/'Reject' actions for that order.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via API response (200 OK), database state change for the order, new entry in the order_event_log table, and a triggered event for the notification service. Frontend UI must update in real-time.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: API call fails during acceptance

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

a vendor is logged in and attempts to accept a new order

### 3.2.5 When

the API call to update the order status fails due to a server error or network issue

### 3.2.6 Then

the order status remains 'Pending Vendor Acceptance', and the vendor dashboard displays a non-blocking error message (e.g., 'Failed to accept order. Please try again.') allowing the vendor to retry the action.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a 5xx API response. Verify the order status in the database has not changed and the frontend displays the specified error message.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Vendor accepts order as auto-rejection timer expires

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

a new order's acceptance timer (defined in REQ-FUN-010) is about to expire

### 3.3.5 When

the system's auto-rejection job updates the order status to 'Cancelled' at the same time the vendor's 'Accept' request is being processed

### 3.3.6 Then

the system must handle the race condition atomically; the first write operation (either auto-rejection or vendor acceptance) wins. If auto-rejection wins, the vendor's API request shall fail with an error indicating the order state has changed, and the UI shall update to show the order as 'Cancelled'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This requires a specific test harness to simulate the race condition. The database transaction for updating the order status must prevent inconsistent states (e.g., using optimistic locking or row-level locks).

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Vendor accepts order as customer cancels

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a new order is within the customer's immediate cancellation window (e.g., 60 seconds as per REQ-BR-003)

### 3.4.5 When

the customer cancels the order at the same time the vendor's 'Accept' request is being processed

### 3.4.6 Then

the customer's cancellation action shall take precedence. The vendor's 'Accept' request shall fail with an error, and the vendor's UI shall update to show the order as 'Cancelled'.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Requires a test to simulate simultaneous API calls for cancelling and accepting the same order. The system logic must prioritize the customer cancellation in this specific window.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

UI Interaction: Preparation time selection is mandatory

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

a vendor has clicked the 'Accept' button for a new order

### 3.5.5 When

the 'Estimated Preparation Time' selection modal is displayed

### 3.5.6 Then

the confirmation button within the modal shall be disabled until the vendor selects one of the time options.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Frontend test to verify the state of the confirmation button based on user interaction within the modal.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A distinct 'Accept' button on each new order card/row.
- A modal dialog that appears upon clicking 'Accept'.
- A list of selectable 'Estimated Preparation Time' options (e.g., radio buttons) inside the modal.
- A 'Confirm' or 'Accept Order' button within the modal.
- A 'Cancel' button or close icon for the modal.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Accept' opens the preparation time modal.
- Selecting a preparation time enables the 'Confirm' button.
- Clicking 'Confirm' in the modal submits the action and closes the modal.
- After confirmation, the order's UI on the dashboard updates to reflect the 'Preparing' status and associated actions.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of preparation times must be sourced from the admin-configurable settings (REQ-FUN-010).
- After acceptance, the order card should clearly display the 'Preparing' status.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Accept' button and modal elements must be keyboard-navigable and screen-reader accessible, compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-017-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

An order can only be accepted if its current status is 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

API endpoint for accepting an order.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API request will be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code and an error message like 'Order is not in a state that can be accepted.'

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-017-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Selecting an estimated preparation time is a mandatory part of the acceptance workflow, as per REQ-FUN-010.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

API endpoint and Frontend UI.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

API will reject requests without a valid preparation time. UI will prevent submission without a selection.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-016

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A vendor must be able to receive and view a new order before they can accept it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

ADM-015

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system requires the admin-configurable list of preparation times to present to the vendor upon acceptance.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

SYS-001

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The auto-rejection logic must exist to handle the race condition scenario defined in AC-003.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Order Management microservice with an endpoint to update order status.
- Notification microservice to trigger customer updates.
- Configuration service or database table to store preparation time options.
- Immutable order event log mechanism.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- An order record must exist in the database with the status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- None for this specific story, as notifications are triggered internally to another service.
