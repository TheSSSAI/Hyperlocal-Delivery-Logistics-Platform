# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly visible search bar at the top of the main vendor list screen.
- A 'clear' icon (e.g., 'x') inside the search bar to quickly erase the query.
- A loading indicator (e.g., spinner) to show while a search is in progress.
- A dedicated search results view with distinct sections for 'Stores' and 'Items'.
- A 'No results found' message display area.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- As the user types, search results should update automatically after a short delay (debouncing) to avoid excessive API calls.
- Tapping on a store result navigates the user to the vendor's profile page.
- Tapping on an item result navigates the user to the parent vendor's profile page.
- The keyboard should automatically appear when the search bar is focused.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Store results must show the store name and may show secondary info like rating or cuisine type.
- Item results must show the item name, price, and the name of the store it belongs to.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The search input field must have an associated label for screen readers.
- Search results must be navigable via accessibility controls (e.g., swipe gestures).
- Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements must be maintained per WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
