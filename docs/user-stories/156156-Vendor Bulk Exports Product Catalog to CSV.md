# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Export Catalog' button on the vendor's product management page.
- A toast notification or inline message to confirm the export process has started.
- An in-app notification center to display the 'download ready' or 'export failed' message.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Export Catalog' button disables it and shows a loading/processing indicator to prevent multiple submissions.
- The 'download ready' notification contains a clickable link that directly initiates the file download.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The exported CSV file must contain a header row with the following columns at a minimum: `product_id`, `product_name`, `description`, `price`, `stock_quantity`, `category_name`, `image_url`.
- The file name must follow the format: `[store_name]_catalog_export_[YYYY-MM-DD].csv`.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Export Catalog' button must be keyboard-focusable and have a descriptive `aria-label`.
- All notifications must be accessible to screen readers (e.g., using `aria-live` regions).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-VND-EXP-01', 'rule_description': "A vendor can only export their own product catalog. The export process must be strictly scoped to the authenticated vendor's data.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API and data access layer.', 'violation_handling': "An attempt to access another vendor's data will result in a 403 Forbidden error and be logged as a security event."}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the core functionality for a vendor to have products in a catalog.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-013

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The export CSV format (headers, data types) must be compatible with the bulk import functionality to enable a seamless export-edit-reimport workflow. This story should define the canonical CSV structure.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Vendor Authentication Service (AWS Cognito)
- Backend service for managing products (Vendor & Catalog microservice)
- Asynchronous task/job queue system (AWS SQS)
- Background job processing environment (e.g., AWS Lambda or worker process in EKS)

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the production database's product and category tables (read-only for this feature).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API call to initiate the export must respond in under 500ms.
- The background export job for a catalog of 5,000 products should complete in under 5 minutes.
- The database query must be optimized to not degrade overall system performance. Consider using streaming to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The generated download link must be a time-limited, pre-signed URL (e.g., S3 pre-signed URL) valid for no more than 24 hours.
- The download link must only be accessible to the authenticated vendor who initiated the export.
- The export process must be hardened against data leakage between vendor accounts.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process should be simple and require minimal steps from the vendor.
- Feedback to the user about the job status (started, ready, failed) must be clear and timely.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor web dashboard must be responsive and functional on all modern web browsers.
- The generated CSV file must be compatible with common spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires implementation of an asynchronous background job processing flow, which adds architectural complexity if not already present.
- Requires robust CSV generation logic to handle large datasets and special characters.
- Involves secure file handling and generation of time-limited access URLs.
- Requires state management for the export job (pending, processing, completed, failed) and corresponding user notifications.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for database performance degradation if the export query for very large catalogs is not optimized.
- Failure handling for the background job must be robust to prevent jobs from getting stuck in a processing state.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Vendor Dashboard Frontend (React.js)
- Vendor & Catalog Microservice (Node.js/NestJS)
- AWS SQS (for job queuing)
- AWS S3 (for file storage)
- Notification Service (for real-time updates)

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🟡 Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story's estimation assumes that the basic infrastructure for background jobs (e.g., SQS queue, worker setup) exists. If not, a separate technical spike or story is needed first, and this story's estimate would increase.
- Requires both frontend and backend development, which can be parallelized after an initial API contract is agreed upon.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a significant quality-of-life improvement for vendors with large catalogs. It can be highlighted in release notes as a feature for power users.
