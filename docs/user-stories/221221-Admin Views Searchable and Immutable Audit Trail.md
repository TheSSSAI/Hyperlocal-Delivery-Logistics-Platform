# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Data table with sortable columns for Timestamp, Actor, Action, and Target Entity
- Date range picker for filtering
- Multi-select or single-select dropdown for filtering by 'Action' type
- Dropdown or autocomplete input for filtering by 'Actor'
- Text-based search input field
- Pagination controls (e.g., 'Previous', 'Next', page numbers)
- A 'Clear Filters' button to reset all search and filter criteria

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking on a table header sorts the data by that column.
- Applying filters updates the table view without a full page reload.
- Hovering over a truncated 'Details' cell could show a tooltip with the full text.
- Clicking a log row could expand it to show more detailed information, like a JSON payload of the event.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Timestamps must be localized to the user's timezone (defaulting to IST as per REQ-INT-005).
- The list of filterable 'Actions' should be populated dynamically from the types of events logged.
- Loading indicators must be shown while data is being fetched or filtered.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The data table must be navigable using a keyboard.
- All filter controls must have proper labels for screen readers.
- The UI must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as per REQ-INT-001.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-AUD-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Audit log entries are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted after being written.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Database and API level. The application API should not expose any endpoints for modification, and database permissions should prevent UPDATE or DELETE operations on the audit table.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Any attempt to violate this rule should be logged as a critical security event and trigger an immediate alert to the security team.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUD-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A comprehensive set of administrative actions must be logged, as defined in REQ-USR-001 and REQ-NFR-008. This includes all CRUD operations on users, changes to system configuration, and manual financial interventions.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Within each microservice that performs a relevant administrative action.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

This is a development requirement. Code reviews must ensure that all specified actions correctly trigger an audit log event.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

ADM-005

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The user management actions (suspend, deactivate) are primary sources of audit events that need to be logged and viewed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

ADM-008

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

System configuration changes (like setting COD limit) are primary sources of audit events.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

SYS-XXX (not defined)

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

A foundational story is required to establish the cross-cutting logging mechanism/service that all other services will use to publish audit events.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A centralized, secure data store for audit logs (e.g., a dedicated PostgreSQL table, AWS QLDB).
- A robust event publishing mechanism (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS) for services to send audit events asynchronously.
- Admin dashboard front-end framework and component library.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to user data to resolve Actor IDs to names/emails.
- A defined taxonomy of auditable 'Action' types.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The initial page load of the audit trail (first 50 records) must complete in under 2 seconds.
- Filtering and searching operations must return results in under 2 seconds, even with over 1 million log entries.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the audit trail is restricted to users with the 'Administrator' role, enforced at the API Gateway and microservice level.
- The immutability of logs must be enforced at the database level to prevent tampering, even by users with direct database access.
- All data in transit between the client and server is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface for filtering and searching must be intuitive for non-technical administrators.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The admin dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The need to implement a robust, distributed logging mechanism across multiple microservices.
- Designing a database schema and queries that remain performant as the data volume grows into millions of records (requires careful indexing and pagination).
- Ensuring true immutability at the database level, which requires more than just application logic.
- Complexity in capturing rich 'before' and 'after' state for modification events.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation over time if the database is not properly managed.
- Inconsistent or missing log entries if the event publishing mechanism is not reliable or if developers forget to implement logging for new admin features.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- All backend microservices that perform auditable administrative actions.
- The central audit log data store.
- The Admin API service that will serve the log data to the frontend.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify that each type of administrative action (user suspension, config change, etc.) generates a correct and complete audit log entry.
- Test all filter and search combinations to ensure they work correctly.
- Perform security testing to confirm that log entries cannot be modified or deleted via any exposed interface.
- Conduct load testing on the audit trail API with a large dataset (e.g., 10 million records) to verify performance requirements are met.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A large volume of mock audit log data with varied actors, actions, and timestamps to test performance, pagination, and filtering.
- Multiple admin test accounts to verify actor filtering.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Cypress for E2E testing of the UI.
- Jest for frontend and backend unit tests.
- A load testing tool like k6 or JMeter for performance validation.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in a staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit and integration test coverage meets the 80% project standard.
- E2E tests for viewing, filtering, and searching are automated and passing.
- Security review confirms the immutability of logs and proper access controls.
- Performance testing confirms the API meets latency requirements under load.
- UI is responsive and meets accessibility standards.
- Technical documentation for the audit logging service and API is created/updated.
- The feature is deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- The cross-cutting concern of the audit logging mechanism should be addressed early, possibly as a technical spike or foundational story before this one.
- This story depends on other features being developed to generate logs. It can be worked on in parallel, using mock data, but final integration testing requires the source features.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a critical feature for the initial launch of the admin dashboard, providing essential security and governance capabilities from day one.
