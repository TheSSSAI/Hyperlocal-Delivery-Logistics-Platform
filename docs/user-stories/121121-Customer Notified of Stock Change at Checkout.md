# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path - All items in cart are available at checkout

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A customer has items in their cart and clicks 'Proceed to Payment'

### 3.1.5 When

The system performs a real-time availability check for all cart items

### 3.1.6 Then

The check confirms all items are available in the requested quantities, and the customer proceeds to the payment gateway selection screen without interruption.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no notification is shown and the checkout flow continues seamlessly. The API call for the check should return a success status.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition - A single item in the cart becomes out of stock

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A customer has 'Product X' in their cart and clicks 'Proceed to Payment'

### 3.2.5 When

The system's real-time check finds that 'Product X' is now out of stock

### 3.2.6 Then

The checkout flow is halted before reaching the payment gateway. A non-dismissible modal/alert is displayed, clearly stating that 'Product X' is no longer available. The modal provides a single action button, such as 'Update Cart'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Use a test setup to change an item's stock to zero after it's added to the cart but before payment is initiated. Verify the modal appears and blocks further action.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition - An item's available quantity is less than the cart quantity

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A customer has 5 units of 'Product Y' in their cart and clicks 'Proceed to Payment'

### 3.3.5 When

The system's real-time check finds that only 3 units of 'Product Y' are now available

### 3.3.6 Then

The checkout flow is halted. A modal is displayed, stating: 'Only 3 units of Product Y are available. Please update your cart.' The modal provides an 'Update Cart' button.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test by reducing an item's stock to a quantity lower than what is in the cart. Verify the message is specific about the available quantity.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case - Multiple items in the cart become unavailable

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A customer's cart contains 'Product X' and 'Product Y' and they proceed to payment

### 3.4.5 When

The system's real-time check finds both items are now out of stock

### 3.4.6 Then

The checkout flow is halted, and the notification modal lists all unavailable items.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the modal content dynamically lists all items that failed the stock check.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Alternative Flow - User updates cart after stock change notification

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

The 'Item Unavailable' modal is displayed to the customer

### 3.5.5 When

The customer clicks the 'Update Cart' button

### 3.5.6 Then

The customer is navigated back to the shopping cart view. The unavailable item(s) are visually highlighted (e.g., red border, 'Out of Stock' badge). The customer can then remove the item and proceed to checkout again successfully with the updated cart.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify the redirection and the visual indicators on the cart page. Ensure the checkout flow works correctly after the cart is modified.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A modal dialog or a full-screen overlay to display the stock-out notification.
- A clear, concise title on the modal, e.g., 'Items Unavailable'.
- A list within the modal displaying the name and image of each unavailable product.
- A single, prominent call-to-action button, e.g., 'Update Cart' or 'Return to Cart'.
- On the cart screen, a visual indicator (e.g., badge, color change) for items that are out of stock.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The stock-out notification must block the user from proceeding with payment.
- Clicking the action button on the modal must navigate the user back to their cart.
- The user must manually remove or update the quantity of the unavailable item before being able to attempt checkout again.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The notification must be unambiguous and easy to understand.
- The cart page must clearly reflect the out-of-stock status of the relevant items upon the user's return.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The notification modal must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- The modal must be keyboard-navigable, and focus should be trapped within it until an action is taken.
- All text must be readable by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-CHK-001', 'rule_description': "A real-time inventory check must be performed for all items in a customer's cart before initiating a transaction with the payment gateway.", 'enforcement_point': 'On the server-side, immediately after the customer confirms their intent to pay from the checkout summary screen.', 'violation_handling': 'If the check is skipped or fails, the transaction should be aborted with a generic error, and the failure logged for investigation. The customer should not be charged.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-016

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the basic ability for a customer to add items to a cart.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-019

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the cart summary/checkout screen where the 'Proceed to Payment' action is triggered.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

VND-011

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the vendor-facing inventory management system to provide real-time stock quantities to check against.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

CUS-025

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the payment processing flow which this story interrupts and modifies.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint in the 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice capable of checking the availability of a list of product IDs in a single batch request.
- Frontend state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit) to manage cart state and API responses.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the real-time inventory database with accurate stock counts for all products.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The server-side batch inventory check API must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of under 200ms to avoid a noticeable delay in the checkout process, as per REQ-NFR-001.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The inventory check API endpoint must be authenticated and authorized, ensuring only the user associated with the current session can check the availability for their cart.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The notification message must be clear, jargon-free, and provide an obvious path to resolution for the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All UI elements related to this feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported mobile application versions and web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes across the frontend application, API Gateway, and the backend 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice.
- The backend logic must handle potential race conditions where multiple users attempt to purchase the last available unit of an item simultaneously. A pessimistic locking or reservation mechanism on the inventory record during the check is recommended.
- Designing a robust and performant batch API endpoint is crucial.
- Frontend state management to handle the interrupted checkout flow can be complex.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poor performance of the inventory check API could lead to increased cart abandonment.
- Failure to properly handle race conditions could still result in overselling, defeating the purpose of the feature.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Client -> API Gateway
- API Gateway -> Order Management Service (to initiate checkout)
- Order Management Service -> Vendor & Catalog Service (for inventory check)

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements
