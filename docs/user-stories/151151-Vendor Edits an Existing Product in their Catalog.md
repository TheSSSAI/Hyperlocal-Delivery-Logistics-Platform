Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A vendor is logged into the vendor dashboard and is viewing their product list

### 3.1.5 When

The vendor selects a product to edit, modifies the name, description, price, stock quantity, category, uploads a new image, and clicks 'Save'

### 3.1.6 Then

The system validates the inputs, updates the product details in the database, stores the new image, and displays a 'Product updated successfully' notification. The vendor is returned to the product list where the updated details are immediately visible.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

The vendor enters a negative value for the price (e.g., '-50') or a non-integer for stock (e.g., 'abc') and clicks 'Save'

### 3.2.6 Then

The form submission is prevented, and a clear, field-specific validation error message is displayed (e.g., 'Price must be a positive number', 'Stock must be a whole number').

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

### 3.3.5 When

The vendor clears the content of a required field like 'Product Name' or 'Price' and clicks 'Save'

### 3.3.6 Then

The form submission is prevented, and a validation error message is displayed next to the empty field (e.g., 'Product name is required').

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

### 3.5.5 When

The vendor changes the stock quantity from 15 to 5 and clicks 'Save'

### 3.5.6 Then

The product's stock quantity is updated to 5, and its derived stock status is automatically changed to 'Limited Stock' and reflected on the customer-facing application.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Check the product's status on the customer app after the change. Test the transition to 'Out of Stock' (quantity 0) and 'Available' (quantity > threshold) as well.

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Attempt to edit a product not owned by the vendor

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

A malicious or mistaken vendor attempts to call the update API with a product ID belonging to another vendor

### 3.6.5 When

The API request to update the product is received by the backend

### 3.6.6 Then

The system's authorization layer rejects the request with a '403 Forbidden' or '404 Not Found' status code, and no changes are made to the product.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to add a product, which defines the product data model and creation flow, must exist before an edit function can be built.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-008

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to manage product categories is required to populate the category selector in the edit form.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

VND-004

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor must be able to log in to access the dashboard where this functionality resides.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (e.g., `PATCH /api/v1/vendor/products/{productId}`) for updating product data.
- Integration with an object storage service (e.g., Amazon S3) for product images.
- A shared UI component library for form elements and notifications.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing product data in the database for a test vendor account.
- Requires existing product category data to populate the category dropdown.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the update operation should be under 500ms (P95) as per platform standards.
- The product edit form should load in under 1.5 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require vendor authentication.
- The system must enforce that a vendor can only edit products belonging to their own store ID (Authorization).
- All user-supplied input must be sanitized on the backend to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The editing process should be intuitive, with clear feedback on success or failure.
- Error messages should be user-friendly and guide the vendor to correct the input.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor web dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Implementing robust client-side and server-side validation for all fields.
- Handling the image update flow, which involves file upload, processing, and storage in S3.
- Ensuring the derived `stock_status` field is updated reliably and transactionally with the `stock_quantity`.
- The API should use a `PATCH` method to allow for partial updates, which is more efficient than `PUT`.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for data inconsistency if the product update and the `stock_status` recalculation are not atomic.
- Failure in the image upload process could lead to a poor user experience; a robust error handling and retry mechanism may be needed.
- Ensuring strict authorization logic is correctly implemented to prevent data breaches between vendors.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend Product Service/Microservice.
- Amazon S3 for image storage.
- Frontend state management (Redux/React Query) to reflect updates in the UI.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful update of each individual field.
- Verify successful update of all fields at once.
- Test all validation rules for price and stock quantity (negative, zero, non-numeric, decimal).
- Test required field validation.
- Test the 'Cancel' functionality.
- Test the image replacement flow, including successful upload and upload failure.
- Automate an E2E test using Cypress that logs in, edits a product, saves, and verifies the change.
- Write an API integration test to confirm a vendor cannot edit another vendor's product.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test vendor account with an approved profile.
- At least two products under the test vendor's account.
- A separate test vendor account to test security/authorization constraints.
- Sample images for upload testing (valid and invalid formats/sizes).

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for unit tests.
- Cypress for End-to-End tests.
- Postman or an equivalent for API-level testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit and integration tests are written and achieve >= 80% code coverage for the new logic.
- Automated E2E tests for the happy path and key error conditions are passing.
- Security checks for authorization have been manually verified and have automated tests.
- The UI is responsive and meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- API documentation (OpenAPI) for the endpoint has been created or updated.
- The feature has been successfully deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a core feature for vendors and is essential for the MVP. It should be prioritized shortly after the 'Add Product' story is completed.
- The frontend and backend work can be done in parallel once the API contract is defined.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is a critical component of the vendor self-service portal. Its absence would significantly hinder a vendor's ability to manage their store on the platform.
