User cancels the deletion process

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

a logged-in customer is on the 'Manage Addresses' screen

### 3.2.5 When

the customer taps the 'Delete' action for an address AND then taps 'Cancel' in the confirmation dialog

### 3.2.6 Then

the confirmation dialog must close, the address must NOT be deleted, AND the address list must remain unchanged.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no API call to delete the address is made and the UI remains static.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Deletion fails due to a network error

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

a logged-in customer has confirmed the deletion of an address

### 3.3.5 When

the mobile application fails to connect to the server to send the delete request

### 3.3.6 Then

the application must display a clear error message (e.g., 'Failed to delete address. Please check your connection.'), the address must NOT be deleted, AND the address list must remain unchanged.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Simulate network failure (e.g., airplane mode) and trigger the delete action. Verify the error message is shown and the address remains in the list.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Deletion fails due to a server-side error

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

a logged-in customer has confirmed the deletion of an address

### 3.4.5 When

the server returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 500)

### 3.4.6 Then

the application must display a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'Something went wrong. Please try again later.'), AND the address must remain in the user's list.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Use a mock server or manipulate the backend to return a 5xx error for the delete endpoint. Verify the UI response.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

User attempts to delete an address owned by another user

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a malicious user is logged in as User A

### 3.5.5 When

the user crafts an API request to delete an address belonging to User B

the server must reject the request with an authorization error (e.g., HTTP 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found) AND User B's address must not be deleted.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This requires an API-level security test. Attempt to call the DELETE endpoint with a valid token for User A but an address ID belonging to User B.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

User deletes their last remaining saved address

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

a logged-in customer is on the 'Manage Addresses' screen and has only one saved address

### 3.6.5 When

the customer successfully deletes their last address

### 3.6.6 Then

the address list must become empty AND an informative 'empty state' message must be displayed (e.g., 'You have no saved addresses.').

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Set up a test user with one address, delete it, and verify the UI shows the correct empty state.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A list view of all saved addresses.
- A 'Delete' icon/button associated with each address entry.
- A confirmation modal/dialog with 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' buttons.
- A non-blocking toast/snackbar for success messages.
- An 'empty state' view to display when no addresses are saved.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Delete' icon triggers the confirmation dialog.
- Tapping 'Confirm' in the dialog initiates the delete API call and closes the dialog.
- Tapping 'Cancel' closes the dialog with no further action.
- The address list should animate the removal of the item for a smooth user experience.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation dialog must clearly state the action, e.g., 'Are you sure you want to delete this address?'
- The success message should be clear and concise, e.g., 'Address deleted successfully.'

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Delete' button must have an accessible label, such as 'Delete address: [Address Line 1]'.
- The confirmation dialog must be focus-trapped and fully navigable via screen readers, in compliance with REQ-INT-001 (WCAG 2.1 AA).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-CUS-001', 'rule_description': 'A user can only delete addresses associated with their own profile.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API service layer before database operation.', 'violation_handling': 'The API must return an authorization error (403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found) to the client.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-003

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be able to log in to access their profile and manage addresses.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-007

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Manage Addresses' screen and the ability to have a saved address must exist before deletion functionality can be added.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A secure backend API endpoint (e.g., DELETE /api/v1/customer/addresses/{addressId}) must be available.
- The customer mobile application must have a dedicated 'Manage Addresses' screen.
- Integration with the authentication service (AWS Cognito) to validate user identity and ownership.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a test user account in the database with at least one saved address.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the DELETE request must be under 500ms (P95), as per platform standards.
- The UI update on the client-side after a successful deletion should feel instantaneous (<100ms).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require a valid JWT from an authenticated user.
- The backend service must perform an ownership check to ensure the requesting user owns the address being deleted (prevents Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The delete action must be easily discoverable.
- A confirmation step is mandatory to prevent accidental data loss.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All UI elements must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (REQ-INT-001).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard CRUD (Delete) operation.
- Frontend work involves UI for the list, a confirmation modal, and state management.
- Backend work involves a single authenticated endpoint with an ownership check.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Minimal risk. The primary concern is ensuring the security check (ownership) is correctly implemented on the backend to prevent unauthorized deletions.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Customer Mobile App <-> API Gateway <-> User/Profile Microservice <-> PostgreSQL Database

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify cancellation of the delete action.
- Verify behavior on network and server errors.
- Verify the UI 'empty state' after deleting the last address.
- Verify that User A cannot delete an address belonging to User B (API-level test).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A primary test user with multiple addresses.
- A secondary test user with at least one address to test security boundaries.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest & React Testing Library (Frontend Unit/Integration)
