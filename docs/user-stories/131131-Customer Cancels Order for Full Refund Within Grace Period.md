# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful cancellation within the 60-second window

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A customer has successfully placed and paid for an order, and its status is 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'

### 3.1.5 When

The customer navigates to the order details screen within 60 seconds of order placement, taps the 'Cancel Order' button, and confirms the action in a dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

The order's status is immediately updated to 'Cancelled' in the system.

### 3.1.7 And

An event is recorded in the immutable order event log (REQ-FUN-017) with the actor 'Customer' and the state change to 'Cancelled'.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify in the database that the order status is 'Cancelled'. Check payment gateway logs to confirm the refund/void API call was made. Verify the UI reflects the change and the vendor dashboard no longer shows the order.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Cancellation option disappears after the 60-second window expires

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

A customer has placed an order and is viewing the order details screen

### 3.2.5 When

The time since order placement exceeds 60 seconds

### 3.2.6 Then

The option to cancel for a full refund is no longer visible or is disabled.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Using a test environment with configurable time, verify that the 'Cancel Order' button is present at 59 seconds and absent at 61 seconds post-order creation.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Customer cancellation takes precedence over vendor acceptance within the grace period

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

A customer has placed an order and its status is 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'

### 3.3.5 And

The system must notify the vendor that the order they just accepted has been cancelled by the customer.

### 3.3.6 When

The customer initiates and confirms a cancellation 50 seconds after placement

### 3.3.7 Then

The cancellation succeeds, the order status becomes 'Cancelled', and a full refund is initiated.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

This requires an integration test to simulate the race condition. The final state of the order must be 'Cancelled', not 'Accepted'.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System handles payment gateway refund failure

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A customer successfully cancels an order within the 60-second window

### 3.4.5 When

The system's call to the payment gateway's refund API fails due to a network error or API downtime

### 3.4.6 Then

The order status is updated to 'Cancelled - Refund Pending'.

### 3.4.7 And

The customer is shown a message indicating the order is cancelled and the refund is being processed (e.g., 'Your order is cancelled. Your refund will be processed shortly.').

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Mock the payment gateway API to return a 5xx error. Verify the order status in the database, check that an alert is logged/sent, and confirm the UI message.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

User interface displays a countdown for the cancellation window

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

A customer is viewing the order details screen for a newly placed order

### 3.5.5 When

Less than 60 seconds have passed since order placement

### 3.5.6 Then

A visual indicator (e.g., 'Cancel for free within XX seconds') is displayed and counts down in real-time.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Manually observe the UI on the customer application to ensure the timer is present, accurate, and disappears after 60 seconds.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A prominent 'Cancel Order' button on the active order screen.
- A confirmation modal/dialog with 'Confirm' and 'Go Back' actions.
- A text-based countdown timer indicating the remaining time for free cancellation.
- A success message/toast notification confirming the cancellation and refund.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping 'Cancel Order' opens the confirmation modal.
- Tapping 'Confirm' in the modal triggers the cancellation logic.
- Tapping 'Go Back' closes the modal with no action.
- After the 60-second window, the 'Cancel Order' button should be hidden or disabled.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The order status must immediately update to 'Cancelled' on the UI.
- The refund amount must be clearly stated in the confirmation message.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Cancel Order' button and confirmation dialog must be accessible to screen readers.
- The countdown timer should be announced by screen readers if possible, or have an accessible text alternative.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-003-A', 'rule_description': 'Customers can cancel an order for a full refund only within 60 seconds of its placement. This is a strict, non-configurable grace period.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend Order Management Service upon receiving a cancellation request.', 'violation_handling': 'The API will reject the cancellation request with an error code indicating the grace period has expired.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-025

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

An order must be successfully paid for before it can be cancelled and refunded.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-026

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires an order confirmation/tracking screen where the 'Cancel Order' button can be placed.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-017

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The cancellation must be recorded in the immutable order event log.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Order Management microservice to handle order state transitions.
- Payment microservice with integration to Razorpay's refund/void transaction API.
- A reliable timestamping mechanism (server-side) to calculate the 60-second window.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The order record must contain a precise `createdAt` timestamp.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Availability of the Razorpay payment gateway's sandbox environment for testing refunds.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the cancellation request must be under 500ms.
- The entire backend process (state change and refund API call) should complete within 2 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The cancellation endpoint must be secured and only accessible by the authenticated user who owns the order.
- All communication with the payment gateway must be over TLS 1.2+.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The cancellation option must be easy to find and use immediately after placing an order.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported versions of the customer mobile application.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Handling the race condition between customer cancellation and vendor acceptance.
- Implementing a robust, potentially distributed transaction to ensure both the order status is updated AND the refund is processed consistently.
- Differentiating between a payment `void` (if not yet captured) and a `refund` (if captured) can optimize transaction fees and speed. The system needs to be aware of the payment capture strategy.
- Reliable error handling and alerting for refund failures.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Inconsistency between order status and refund status if the payment gateway API fails and is not handled gracefully.
- Clock skew between different microservices could affect the 60-second rule if not managed with a single source of truth for time.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Order Management Service (update order status).
- Payment Service (initiate refund with Razorpay).
- Notification Service (send cancellation confirmation to customer).
- Vendor Service (remove order from vendor's view).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements
