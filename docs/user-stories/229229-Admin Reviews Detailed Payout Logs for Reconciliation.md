# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-021

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The core financial settlement and payout system must be implemented first. This story relies on the existence of payout attempt data being generated and logged.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

ADM-005

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the basic Admin Dashboard framework and user management to be in place for navigation and access control.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

REQ-NFR-008

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Admin access to this sensitive financial data must be logged in the system's audit trail.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend database table designed to store detailed payout log information, including all fields from the payment gateway response.
- A dedicated backend API endpoint to serve, filter, search, and paginate the payout log data securely.
- The 'Payments & Settlements' microservice must reliably log every payout attempt to this table.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to Vendor and Rider profile data to link payee IDs to names.
- Access to payout transaction data generated by the settlement process.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- The structure and content of the failure reasons are dependent on the API response format of the RazorpayX payout service.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The Payout Logs page must load within 3 seconds.
- API response time for filtering and searching on an indexed dataset of 100,000+ records must be under 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The admin dashboard must be fully functional on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend: Requires a well-designed, indexed database schema to handle potentially large volumes of log data efficiently.
- Backend: Building a robust API with combined filtering, full-text search, and pagination capabilities.
- Frontend: Implementing a performant data grid component that handles server-side data fetching and state management for filters.
- Data Integrity: Ensuring the payout service captures and logs every attempt, especially network failures or timeouts during communication with the payment gateway.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poor database indexing could lead to slow performance as the log table grows.
- Incomplete logging in the payout service could lead to missing data, undermining the purpose of reconciliation.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Reads data from the Payout Logs database table.
- Integrates with the User (Vendor/Rider) database table to fetch payee names.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Validate the contents and format of the exported CSV file.
- Test with a large, seeded dataset in staging to check performance.
- Attempt to access the page as a non-admin user to verify access control.
- Manually trigger a failed payout in staging and confirm the log entry contains the correct error message from the payment gateway.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of test users (Vendors, Riders) with associated bank accounts.
- A large dataset of mock payout logs (~10,000+ entries) with a mix of 'Success', 'Failed', and 'Pending' statuses.

- Jest for unit tests.
- Cypress for E2E tests.
- A database seeding script for performance testing.
