# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A main search bar for text-based queries.
- Dropdown filters for 'User Role' and 'Account Status'.
- A data table/grid to display the list of users.
- Clickable column headers for sorting.
- Pagination controls (e.g., 'Previous', 'Next', page numbers).
- An 'Actions' dropdown menu or icon group in each user row.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Search should trigger after a debounce interval (e.g., 300ms) on text input or via a search button.
- Applying a filter should immediately refresh the user list.
- Clicking a column header toggles sort order (ASC/DESC).
- The UI should show a loading indicator while data is being fetched.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The table must display: Full Name, User Role, Phone Number, Account Status (e.g., as a colored badge), and Registration Date.
- A count of total matching users should be displayed.
- Current filter and search terms should remain visible.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All UI controls (search, filters, buttons) must be keyboard accessible.
- The data table must be properly structured with `<th>` for headers for screen reader compatibility.
- Complies with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires customer user data to exist in the system to be displayed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

- Authentication service (AWS Cognito) to enforce administrator-only access.
- A unified data model or view in the database to query all user types together efficiently.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the central user database/tables containing customer, vendor, and rider information.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- API P95 latency for fetching/filtering users must be < 500ms.
- Admin dashboard page (LCP) should load in under 2.5 seconds as per REQ-NFR-001.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to this feature must be strictly limited to the 'Administrator' role via RBAC (REQ-USR-001).
- All user data must be transmitted over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ (REQ-INT-004).
- Input from search and filter fields must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks (OWASP Top 10).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface must be intuitive for non-technical administrators.
- The state of filters, search, and pagination should be maintained, potentially using URL query parameters, to allow for bookmarking and sharing.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The admin web dashboard must be responsive and function correctly on all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend query optimization is critical to ensure performance with a large user base. This requires careful database indexing on searchable and filterable fields.
- Frontend state management to handle the combination of search, multiple filters, sorting, and pagination simultaneously.
- Creating a unified API response from potentially separate user tables (if not using a single user table model) adds complexity.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poorly optimized database queries could lead to slow API response times and timeouts as the user base grows.
- Complex frontend state can lead to bugs if not managed properly with a library like Redux Toolkit or React Query.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- AWS Cognito for user authentication and role verification.
- PostgreSQL database for user data retrieval.
- Frontend React application for the UI.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify each filter works independently and in combination.
- Test search with various inputs (full, partial, case-insensitive).
- Test pagination forwards, backwards, and jumping to specific pages.
- Test sorting on all sortable columns, both ascending and descending.
- Automate an E2E test using Cypress that simulates an admin logging in and using all features of the user management page.
- Conduct a load test on the API endpoint with a large, seeded database.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A database seeded with a significant number of users (>10,000) across all roles and statuses to test performance and pagination.
- Specific user records with known names, roles, and statuses for predictable testing of search and filters.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational feature for the admin panel. It should be prioritized early as other user management stories (suspend, deactivate, edit) will depend on its UI.
- Requires both frontend and backend development effort, which can be parallelized once the API contract is defined.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This story is a key component of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for administrative functionality.
