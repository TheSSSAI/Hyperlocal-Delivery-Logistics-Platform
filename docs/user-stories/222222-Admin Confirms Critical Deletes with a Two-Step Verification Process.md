# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Admin successfully confirms and deletes a critical entity

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

the Administrator is logged into the admin dashboard and is viewing the details of a critical entity (e.g., a Vendor named 'Global Foods')

### 3.1.5 When

the Administrator clicks the enabled 'Confirm Delete' button

### 3.1.6 Then

the system must process the deletion of the 'Global Foods' vendor.

### 3.1.7 And

the Administrator must be redirected to the entity list page with a success notification, e.g., 'Vendor \'Global Foods\' was successfully deleted.'

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Admin cancels the deletion process from the confirmation modal

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

the two-step delete confirmation modal is displayed for a critical entity

### 3.2.5 When

the Administrator clicks the 'Cancel' button or closes the modal using the 'X' icon or pressing the ESC key

### 3.2.6 Then

the modal must close immediately.

### 3.2.7 And

no delete operation must be performed, and the entity must remain unchanged in the system.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Admin enters incorrect text into the confirmation field

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

the two-step delete confirmation modal is displayed

### 3.3.5 When

the Administrator types text that does not exactly match the required confirmation string (e.g., 'Global Food' instead of 'Global Foods')

### 3.3.6 Then

the 'Confirm Delete' button must remain disabled.

### 3.3.7 And

if the user corrects the text to the exact match, the button must become enabled.

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System handles API failure during the delete operation

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

the Administrator has correctly filled the confirmation modal and clicked 'Confirm Delete'

### 3.4.5 When

the backend API call to delete the entity fails for any reason (e.g., network error, database constraint)

### 3.4.6 Then

the modal must close and a prominent, user-friendly error message must be displayed, e.g., 'Error: Could not delete the entity. Please try again or contact support.'

### 3.4.7 And

the entity must not be deleted from the system.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

The two-step confirmation is applied to all defined critical entities

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

the Administrator attempts to delete any of the following entity types

### 3.5.5 When

the delete action is initiated for a User (Customer, Vendor, Rider), a Vendor Store, or an Operational Zone

### 3.5.6 Then

the two-step confirmation process as defined in AC-001 must be triggered.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This ensures the feature is applied consistently across all high-impact areas. Non-critical deletes, like a single product in a vendor's catalog, should not trigger this modal.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A reusable modal dialog component.
- Modal Title (e.g., 'Confirm Permanent Deletion').
- Dynamic warning text area that includes the entity type and name.
- Text input field for confirmation.
- A primary, destructive-action button (e.g., red color) labeled 'Confirm Delete', disabled by default.
- A secondary button labeled 'Cancel'.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the initial 'Delete' button triggers the modal.
- The 'Confirm Delete' button is enabled/disabled based on real-time validation of the text input against the required string.
- The modal must be dismissible via the 'Cancel' button, the 'X' icon, or the ESC key.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The modal must clearly and unambiguously state what is being deleted and that the action is permanent.
- The required confirmation text must be an exact, case-sensitive match to the entity's name or identifier.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The modal must trap focus, preventing keyboard navigation to the underlying page.
- All modal elements (buttons, input field) must be keyboard accessible and have proper ARIA attributes.
- The destructive nature of the primary button should be conveyed to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-ADM-DEL-01', 'rule_description': 'A two-step confirmation is mandatory for deleting critical system entities.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side (Admin Web App) before sending the final delete request to the API.', 'violation_handling': 'The API request for deletion is not sent until the confirmation is successfully completed.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

ADM-005

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the basic UI and functionality for managing users, vendors, and zones where the 'Delete' action originates.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

ADM-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the audit trail system to be in place to log the successful completion of a critical delete, as specified in the acceptance criteria.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A generic modal component in the React frontend library.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware on the backend to ensure only Administrators can access delete APIs.
- The central Audit Logging service/module.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The confirmation modal must render in under 200ms after the initial delete action is triggered.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All API endpoints for deleting critical entities MUST be protected by RBAC, restricting access to the 'Administrator' role only.
- The successful execution of a critical delete MUST be logged in the immutable audit trail as per REQ-NFR-008.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The warning message must be unambiguous to prevent any user confusion about the consequence of the action.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The modal implementation must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for dialogs.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers for the Admin dashboard.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires creating a reusable frontend component and applying it consistently across multiple parts of the admin dashboard.
- Backend logic must correctly identify which operations are 'critical' and ensure audit logs are generated from different services.
- The definition of 'delete' (soft delete vs. hard delete vs. anonymization) must be clarified and implemented consistently with platform data retention policies (REQ-CON-001, REQ-NFR-007). A soft-delete or anonymization approach is strongly recommended to prevent irreversible data loss that could break referential integrity of historical records (e.g., orders).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of inconsistent application of the confirmation logic, where some critical deletes might miss this safeguard.
- Potential for cascading delete issues in the database if a hard-delete strategy is chosen, which could lead to unintended data loss.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Admin Web Application (React).
- Backend services responsible for managing Users, Vendors, and Zones.
- Audit Logging Service.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful deletion of a Vendor after correct confirmation.
- Verify deletion is aborted when the modal is cancelled.
- Verify the confirm button remains disabled with incorrect input.
- Verify the feature works for all identified critical entity types (Users, Vendors, Zones).
- Verify that a non-admin user cannot trigger the delete API endpoint.
- Verify the audit log entry is created correctly upon successful deletion.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test administrator account.
- Sample entities (Vendor, Rider, Customer, Zone) that can be safely deleted during automated and manual testing.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest & React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Cypress for E2E testing of the full admin workflow.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer
- Unit and integration tests implemented with >80% coverage for new code
- E2E tests for the primary happy path and cancel flow are implemented and passing
- The confirmation modal is successfully implemented for ALL defined critical delete operations
- The feature is verified to be secure and accessible only to Administrators
- An audit log is successfully generated upon confirmed deletion
- UI/UX has been reviewed and approved
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a critical safety feature for the admin role. It should be implemented before providing admins with delete capabilities in a production environment.
- The work can be broken down: implement the reusable component and apply it to one entity type first (e.g., Vendor), then create smaller tasks/stories to apply it to other entities.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

Enhances the safety and reliability of the admin dashboard, reducing the risk of human error impacting production data. Essential for a stable V1.0 launch.
