# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path - Approve a valid Vendor registration

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an Administrator logged into the admin dashboard and viewing a Vendor's registration with a 'pending_verification' status

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Approve' button and confirm the action in the confirmation modal

### 3.1.6 Then

The system must change the Vendor's account status to 'active', a success notification ('[Vendor Name] has been approved.') must be displayed, the Vendor must be removed from the 'Pending Registrations' list, an approval notification must be sent to the Vendor, and an entry must be created in the audit trail logging this action.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the status change in the database. Check the notification service logs for the sent notification. Query the audit log for the corresponding entry. Attempt to log in as the vendor to confirm they can access their dashboard.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Happy Path - Approve a valid Rider registration

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am an Administrator logged into the admin dashboard and viewing a Rider's registration with a 'pending_verification' status

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Approve' button and confirm the action in the confirmation modal

### 3.2.6 Then

The system must change the Rider's account status to 'active', a success notification ('[Rider Name] has been approved.') must be displayed, the Rider must be removed from the 'Pending Registrations' list, an approval notification must be sent to the Rider, and an entry must be created in the audit trail logging this action.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the status change in the database. Check the notification service logs for the sent notification. Query the audit log for the corresponding entry. Attempt to log in as the rider to confirm they can go 'Online'.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition - Attempting to approve a registration already processed

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am viewing a pending registration that another administrator has just approved or rejected

### 3.3.5 When

I click the 'Approve' button

### 3.3.6 Then

The system must prevent the action and display an error message, such as 'This registration has already been processed. Please refresh the page.' The user's status must not be changed by my action.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This can be tested by having two test sessions. Process the user in one session and then attempt to process in the second. The second attempt must fail gracefully.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System Resilience - Notification service fails during approval

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

I approve a valid registration

### 3.4.5 When

The backend service responsible for sending notifications is unavailable

### 3.4.6 Then

The user's status must still be successfully updated to 'active', the audit log entry must be created, and the UI must show the success message. The system must log the notification failure and queue it for a retry attempt.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Requires the ability to simulate a notification service failure in a test environment. Verify the user status is updated correctly despite the downstream failure.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Audit Trail Logging

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

I am an Administrator

### 3.5.5 When

I successfully approve any registration

### 3.5.6 Then

A new, immutable entry must be created in the audit trail containing the timestamp, my administrator ID, the ID of the approved user, the action performed ('REGISTRATION_APPROVED'), and the target user type ('VENDOR' or 'RIDER').

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Query the audit log database or API to confirm the presence and correctness of the new log entry after an approval action.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Approve' button on the registration details view.
- A confirmation modal dialog with 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' actions.
- A non-intrusive success notification (e.g., toast message) upon successful completion.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Approve' must trigger the confirmation modal.
- Confirming the action proceeds with the approval; canceling closes the modal with no change.
- After successful approval, the user should be redirected back to the updated list of pending registrations.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal must state the name and type (Vendor/Rider) of the user being approved, e.g., 'Are you sure you want to approve Vendor: [Vendor Name]?'

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Approve' button and confirmation modal must be keyboard accessible and screen-reader friendly, compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
