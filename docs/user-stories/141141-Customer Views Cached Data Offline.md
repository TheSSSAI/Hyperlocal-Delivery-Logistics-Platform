# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent, non-intrusive banner or status indicator displayed globally when the application is offline.
- Disabled (grayed-out) state for all buttons and interactive elements that require a network connection.
- Toast or snackbar notification for displaying network-related error messages.
- Empty state UI for screens that have no cached data to display.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping on disabled elements should trigger the 'No internet connection' message.
- The app should not show indefinite loading spinners when offline; requests should fail fast with an appropriate message.
- Pull-to-refresh on cached screens should be disabled or trigger the offline message.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Cached cart must show item name, image, quantity, and price.
- Cached order history must show order ID, date, status, and total amount.
- The offline indicator must be clearly visible and understandable.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The offline status indicator must be accessible to screen readers.
- Disabled buttons must be properly marked as disabled for assistive technologies.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-OFF-001', 'rule_description': 'The application must not attempt to initiate any financial transaction or state-changing API call (e.g., place order, update profile) while in an offline state.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side, before any network request is constructed.', 'violation_handling': 'The action is blocked, and the user is notified of the offline status.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-019

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The cart summary screen must exist to be adapted for offline viewing.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-039

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The order history screen must exist to be adapted for offline viewing.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A client-side caching/persistence library for React Native (e.g., Redux Persist, MMKV, or AsyncStorage).
- A reliable network information library to detect online/offline status changes.
- Global state management (Redux Toolkit) to handle the app-wide network state and cached data.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- This story depends on data fetched by other features (cart and order history) being available to cache.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Loading data from the local cache must be near-instantaneous (<100ms).
- The network detection logic should not introduce any noticeable performance overhead to the application.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- No sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens, full PII) beyond what is necessary for display should be stored in the cache. The existing secure storage for tokens (as per REQ-FUN-002) should be used.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The offline experience should be intuitive, clearly communicating the app's status and limitations to the user without causing confusion.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All offline UI elements must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The offline detection and caching mechanism must work reliably on supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires setting up a robust, app-wide mechanism for network state detection.
- Requires implementing a data caching and hydration strategy (e.g., using Redux Persist).
- Requires refactoring existing screens (Cart, Order History) to adopt a cache-first or stale-while-revalidate data fetching pattern.
- UI work is required to create a global offline indicator and handle disabled states consistently.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Inaccurate network state detection can lead to a poor user experience (e.g., app thinks it's offline when it's not).
- Poorly managed cache can lead to stale data being shown to the user even when they are back online.
- Cache invalidation strategy needs to be considered for future stories.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the global state management (Redux store).
- Affects any component that fetches data, starting with Cart and Order History.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify cart screen renders cached data when offline.
- Verify order history screen renders cached data when offline.
- Verify online-only buttons are disabled and provide feedback on tap.
- Verify smooth transition from offline to online state, including UI updates.
- Verify correct empty state is shown for screens with no cached data.
- Verify app behavior on intermittent/flaky network connections.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user account with items in the cart.
- A test user account with a populated order history.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
