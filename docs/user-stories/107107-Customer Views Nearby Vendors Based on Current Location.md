the system fetches the customer's current GPS coordinates AND a list of vendors is displayed.

### 3.1.7 And

each item in the list must display the vendor's name, primary category (e.g., cuisine), average star rating, and a primary image.

### 3.6.5 When

the application attempts to get the current location

### 3.6.6 Then

after a timeout of 5 seconds, the application displays an error message like 'Could not determine your location. Please check your connection and try again.'

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A scrollable list or grid of 'Vendor Cards'
- A skeleton loader/placeholder for the vendor list
- An error message display area for permission denial or location failure
- A 'Go to Settings' button for the permission denial state
- An empty state message for when no vendors are found

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The app must prompt the user for location permissions upon first use of the feature.
- The user can scroll vertically through the list of vendors.
- Tapping on a vendor card will navigate the user to the vendor's detail screen (covered in another story, e.g., CUS-013).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Each vendor card must clearly display: Vendor Name, Vendor Image, Average Rating, and Primary Category/Cuisine.
- The list should be sorted by a default relevance algorithm (e.g., a weighted score of distance and rating).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Vendor images must have appropriate alt-text for screen readers.
- The list must be navigable using accessibility controls.
- Text and background colors must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The system must support vendor registration to have vendors to display.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-007

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Vendors must be able to set their availability (Online/Offline) status, which is a core filter for this story.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

ADM-009

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Administrators must be able to configure the delivery radius, which is a required parameter for the vendor search logic.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

ADM-013

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Administrators must be able to define operational zones to determine service availability.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Mobile application requires access to native device GPS/location APIs (iOS CoreLocation, Android Location Services).
- Backend database (PostgreSQL) must have the PostGIS extension enabled for efficient geospatial queries.
- A backend API endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/vendors/nearby) must be created to handle the location-based query.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The 'vendors' table in the database must contain location data (latitude/longitude) stored in a geography/geometry column with a spatial index.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Reliant on the device's operating system to provide accurate location data.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The 95th percentile (P95) latency for the backend API call to fetch nearby vendors must be under 200ms (ref: REQ-NFR-001).
- The mobile app UI must remain responsive while location and vendor data are being fetched.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Customer location data (latitude/longitude) should be transmitted securely over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
- Location data should only be used for the purpose of finding nearby vendors and not stored long-term without explicit consent.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of granting location permission and seeing vendors should feel seamless and intuitive.
- Error messages must be clear, concise, and provide actionable guidance.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (ref: REQ-INT-001).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on the supported versions of iOS and Android.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Handling location permissions and their various states (granted, denied, asked-for-the-first-time, permanently-denied) across both iOS and Android platforms.
- Implementing an efficient geospatial query on the backend that scales with a large number of vendors and users. This requires proper database indexing (GIST index on the location column).
- Designing a robust UI that gracefully handles all states: loading, success with data, success with empty data, and multiple error conditions (no permission, no GPS signal, API failure).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Inaccurate GPS data from devices can lead to a poor user experience.
- A poorly optimized backend query could become a performance bottleneck as the platform scales.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Mobile Client <-> Native Location Services (iOS/Android)
- Mobile Client <-> Backend Vendor Discovery API
- Backend Vendor Discovery API <-> PostgreSQL/PostGIS Database

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify the permission denial flow on both iOS and Android.
- Verify the UI state when the API returns an empty list.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of test vendors with known geolocations, some inside and some outside a test delivery radius.
- Vendors with 'Online' and 'Offline' statuses.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story for the customer mobile application and is a prerequisite for the entire ordering flow. It should be prioritized in an early sprint.
- A clear API contract between the frontend and backend teams must be established at the beginning of the sprint to enable parallel development.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is critical for the initial MVP launch. The application cannot function without it.
