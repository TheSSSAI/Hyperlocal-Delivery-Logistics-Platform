# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Vendor successfully sets a valid 'Limited Stock' threshold

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a logged-in vendor is on the 'Store Settings' page of their dashboard

### 3.1.5 When

the vendor enters a valid, positive whole number (e.g., 5) into the 'Limited Stock Threshold' input field and clicks 'Save'

### 3.1.6 Then

the system persists the new threshold value for the vendor's store and displays a success confirmation message.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the value is correctly saved in the 'stores' or 'vendor_profiles' database table. The success message should be clear and disappear after a few seconds.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Product status correctly displays as 'Limited Stock' on the customer app

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a vendor has set their 'Limited Stock Threshold' to 10

### 3.2.5 And

they have a product with a stock quantity of 7

### 3.2.6 When

a customer views that product's listing or details page

### 3.2.7 Then

the system displays the product's stock status as 'Limited Stock'.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Test with quantity equal to the threshold (10) and below the threshold (e.g., 1). Both should show 'Limited Stock'.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Product status correctly displays as 'Available' on the customer app

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a vendor has set their 'Limited Stock Threshold' to 10

### 3.3.5 And

they have a product with a stock quantity of 11

### 3.3.6 When

a customer views that product's listing

### 3.3.7 Then

the system displays the product's stock status as 'Available'.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

The logic should be `quantity > threshold`.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Product status correctly displays 'Out of Stock' regardless of threshold

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.4.4 Given

a vendor has set their 'Limited Stock Threshold' to 10

### 3.4.5 And

they have a product with a stock quantity of 0

### 3.4.6 When

a customer views that product's listing

### 3.4.7 Then

the system displays the product's stock status as 'Out of Stock'.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

The 'Out of Stock' status (quantity <= 0) must always take precedence over the 'Limited Stock' threshold.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System rejects non-numeric input for the threshold

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a logged-in vendor is on the 'Store Settings' page

### 3.5.5 When

the vendor enters a non-numeric string (e.g., 'ten') into the threshold field and attempts to save

### 3.5.6 Then

the system prevents the save action and displays an inline validation error message, such as 'Please enter a valid whole number'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The field should not be updated in the database.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

System rejects negative or decimal input for the threshold

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

a logged-in vendor is on the 'Store Settings' page

### 3.6.5 When

the vendor enters a negative number (e.g., -5) or a decimal (e.g., 4.5) into the threshold field and attempts to save

### 3.6.6 Then

the system prevents the save action and displays an inline validation error message, such as 'Value must be a whole number of 0 or greater'.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

The field should not be updated in the database.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

A new vendor sees a system default value for the threshold

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.7.4 Given

a new vendor has completed registration and logs in for the first time

### 3.7.5 When

they navigate to the 'Store Settings' page

### 3.7.6 Then

the 'Limited Stock Threshold' input field is pre-populated with a system-defined default value (e.g., 5).

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

This ensures consistent behavior for vendors who have not explicitly configured this setting.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled numerical input field for 'Limited Stock Threshold' on the Vendor Dashboard's store settings page.
- Help text or a tooltip explaining what the threshold does (e.g., 'Products at or below this quantity will show as Limited Stock').
- A 'Save' button to persist the setting.
- Inline validation message area for error display.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Vendor can type a numerical value into the input field.
- The input field should only accept whole numbers.
- Clicking 'Save' triggers a backend API call to update the setting.
- Success or error feedback is provided to the vendor after the save attempt.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The current saved threshold value must be displayed in the input field when the page loads.
- On the customer-facing application, the product status text ('Available', 'Limited Stock', 'Out of Stock') must be clearly visible on product list items and product detail pages.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The input field must have a proper `<label>` tag for screen readers.
- Validation errors must be programmatically associated with the input field using `aria-describedby`.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-LST-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The 'Limited Stock' threshold must be a non-negative integer (0 or greater).

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Frontend validation on input and Backend API validation upon submission.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The submission is rejected, and an informative error message is displayed to the user.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-LST-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The stock status logic is hierarchical: 'Out of Stock' (quantity <= 0) overrides 'Limited Stock' (0 < quantity <= threshold), which overrides 'Available' (quantity > threshold).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service responsible for retrieving and preparing product data for display.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A - System logic.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-005

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story requires the existence of a Vendor 'Store Profile' or 'Settings' page where the new configuration field can be added.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story modifies the display logic based on a product's stock quantity, which is defined in the product creation story.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

CUS-014

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story alters the logic that determines the stock status displayed to the customer, which is a feature implemented in CUS-014.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Backend: A database schema modification is required to add a `limited_stock_threshold` column to the vendor/store table.
- Backend: The API endpoint for updating store settings must be extended to handle the new field.
- Frontend: The Vendor Dashboard's store settings component must be updated.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A system-wide default value for the threshold needs to be defined.
- A data migration may be required to populate the new `limited_stock_threshold` field for all existing vendors with the default value.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API call to save the threshold setting should respond in under 200ms (P95).
- The additional logic to check the threshold should not add more than 10ms to the product data retrieval API response time.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Only an authenticated vendor user with appropriate permissions can modify their own store's threshold.
- All input must be sanitized on the backend to prevent injection attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The setting should be easy to find within the vendor dashboard.
- The purpose of the setting and any error messages should be clearly communicated in simple language.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The vendor dashboard interface for this feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor dashboard feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes across the stack: database, backend API, and frontend UI.
- A data migration script for existing vendors adds an operational step.
- The business logic for calculating stock status is centralized, making the change straightforward. If it's decentralized, complexity increases.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of inconsistent stock status display if the new logic is not applied to all relevant customer-facing endpoints (e.g., search, product details, cart).
- Forgetting to run the data migration could lead to null values and unexpected behavior for existing vendors.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Vendor/Store database table.
- Vendor settings update API endpoint.
- Product data retrieval service/API endpoint(s).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a vendor can set, update, and see their threshold setting.
- Verify invalid inputs (negative, decimal, text) are rejected.
- Verify product status for a customer reflects the vendor's setting correctly for quantities above, at, and below the threshold.
- Verify 'Out of Stock' status always takes precedence.
- Verify new vendors see the default threshold value.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test vendor accounts (one new, one existing).
- Products with various stock levels: 0, 1, 5, 10, 11 (assuming a threshold of 5 or 10 is used for testing).

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for backend and frontend unit tests.
- Cypress for End-to-End testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit tests for backend validation and business logic achieve >80% coverage.
- Unit tests for the frontend component are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests confirm the API endpoint correctly updates the database.
- E2E tests (Cypress) successfully simulate a vendor setting the threshold and a customer seeing the correct product status.
- Data migration script for existing vendors has been created, tested, and is ready for deployment.
- Any relevant documentation (e.g., knowledge base for vendors) has been updated.
- Story has been deployed and verified in the staging environment by QA.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🟡 Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations
