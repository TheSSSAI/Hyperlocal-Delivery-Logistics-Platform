### 3.2.4 Given

a customer has selected 'Cash on Delivery' and confirmed their order

### 3.2.5 When

the customer taps the 'Place Order' button

the customer must still receive the SMS and push notification confirmations, and the new order must be visible in their 'Order History' upon relaunching the app.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

the external notification service (FCM/SNS) is down or returns an error

### 3.6.6 Then

the in-app confirmation screen must still be displayed to the user without any visible error, and the notification failure must be logged in the backend for monitoring.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use a mock service to simulate a failure from the notification provider's API. Verify the UI flow is unaffected and an error is logged in CloudWatch.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Full-screen confirmation view/page
- Success icon (e.g., large checkmark)
- Primary header text (e.g., 'Order Placed!')
- Text fields for Order ID, Vendor Name, Total Amount
- Primary Button: 'Track Order'
- Secondary Link/Button: 'Back to Home'

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User is automatically navigated to this screen upon successful order placement.
- Tapping 'Track Order' navigates the user to the live tracking screen for this specific order.
- Tapping 'Back to Home' navigates the user to the main vendor discovery screen.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Order ID must be clearly visible and copyable.
- Total amount must be formatted correctly for INR (â‚¹).
- For COD, the text 'Payable on Delivery' must be prominent next to the total amount.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All text must have sufficient color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Screen reader support for all elements, announcing the successful order placement and key details.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-CONF-001', 'rule_description': "Confirmation must be triggered only after the order state is successfully persisted as 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' in the database.", 'enforcement_point': 'Order Management Service, post-payment confirmation.', 'violation_handling': 'If the order fails to save, the transaction should be rolled back/refunded, and the user should be shown an error screen, not a confirmation screen.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-025

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story is triggered by the successful completion of an online payment.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-022

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story handles the confirmation for orders placed via COD, which is a payment method selected in CUS-022.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

SYS-XXX (Implied)

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires backend logic (covered by REQ-FUN-017) to create an order record and set its initial state.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Order Management microservice must be able to create and persist order data.
- Integration with the payment gateway's success callback/webhook (Razorpay).
- A notification service capable of sending SMS (via AWS SNS) and push notifications (via FCM).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a successfully processed cart object to derive order details.
- Requires customer's registered mobile number and device token for notifications.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
- AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) for SMS.
- Razorpay Payment Gateway for payment success confirmation.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The latency between payment success and the display of the in-app confirmation screen must be less than 1 second.
- Push/SMS notifications should be dispatched by the system within 5 seconds of order creation.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The confirmation screen and notifications must not display any sensitive PII other than what is necessary (e.g., no full address, just confirmation of order).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The confirmation must be unambiguous and reassuring to the user, leaving no doubt about the order's success.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The confirmation screen must render correctly on all supported iOS and Android devices.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordination between frontend and backend.
- Backend logic involves handling a payment gateway callback, which is an external, asynchronous trigger.
- Implementation of an event-driven pattern: The Order service should publish an `OrderPlaced` event, and a separate Notification service should consume it. This adds resilience but also architectural complexity.
- Ensuring idempotency in the order creation process to prevent duplicate orders if a payment callback is received more than once.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Latency or failure of the payment gateway callback could delay or prevent order confirmation.
- Failure in the event bus (SQS/SNS) could prevent notifications from being sent.
- Potential for a race condition if the user navigates away too quickly after payment submission.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Order Service <- Payment Gateway (Webhook/Callback)
- Order Service -> Message Bus (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS)
- Message Bus -> Notification Service
- Notification Service -> FCM API
- Notification Service -> AWS SNS API

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify confirmation for a COD order.
- Simulate a payment success callback followed by an app crash to test order persistence and out-of-app notification.
- Use service mocks to simulate FCM/SNS API failures and verify the system's graceful handling.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test customer accounts with valid mobile numbers and device tokens.
- Mock payment credentials for successful transactions.
- Pre-configured products and vendors in the test database.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
