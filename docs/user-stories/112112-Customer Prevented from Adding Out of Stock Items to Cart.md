# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Disabled 'Add to Cart' button for out-of-stock items on the product list view.

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A customer is viewing a list of products from a vendor

### 3.1.5 When

A product in the list has a stock status of 'Out of Stock'

### 3.1.6 Then

The 'Add to Cart' button for that specific product must be visually disabled (e.g., greyed out) and non-interactive.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify visually and by attempting to tap the button. No action should occur, and the cart icon/count should not update.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Disabled 'Add to Cart' button for out-of-stock items on the product detail page.

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

A customer is viewing the detail page for a specific product

### 3.2.5 When

The product has a stock status of 'Out of Stock'

### 3.2.6 Then

The main 'Add to Cart' button on the page must be visually disabled and non-interactive.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify visually and by attempting to tap the button. No action should occur.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Backend rejects adding an out-of-stock item via API call.

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A product exists with a stock quantity of zero

### 3.3.5 When

The system receives an API request to add this product to a customer's cart

### 3.3.6 Then

The API must return an error response (e.g., 409 Conflict) with a clear message like 'ITEM_OUT_OF_STOCK' and must not add the item to the cart.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This is a server-side validation test. Check the API response code and body, and verify the cart's contents in the database remain unchanged.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Item goes out of stock just before the customer adds it to the cart (race condition).

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A customer is viewing a product detail page for an item with a stock quantity of 1

### 3.4.5 And

Another transaction causes the item's stock to become 0

### 3.4.6 When

The customer taps the 'Add to Cart' button

### 3.4.7 Then

The backend API must reject the request, and the customer's app should display a user-friendly, non-blocking message (e.g., a toast notification) stating 'Sorry, this item just went out of stock'.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Requires a scripted test to simulate the race condition. Verify the UI feedback and that the cart is not updated.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Customer can add 'Available' or 'Limited Stock' items to the cart.

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

A customer is viewing a product with a stock status of 'Available' or 'Limited Stock'

### 3.5.5 When

The customer taps the 'Add to Cart' button

### 3.5.6 Then

The item is successfully added to the cart, and the cart's item count is updated.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This confirms the prevention logic is correctly scoped only to 'Out of Stock' items.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A visually disabled 'Add to Cart' button.
- A clear text label or badge on the product listing indicating 'Out of Stock'.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The disabled 'Add to Cart' button must not be interactive (i.e., no click/tap event should fire).
- No hover effects should apply to the disabled button.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The 'Out of Stock' status must be clearly visible on both product list items and the product detail page.
- The disabled button's appearance must be distinct enough from an active button to be immediately recognizable.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The disabled state of the button must be programmatically conveyed to screen readers (e.g., `aria-disabled='true'` for web, `accessibilityState={{disabled: true}}` for React Native).
- The 'Out of Stock' status should not be communicated by color alone.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-INV-001', 'rule_description': "A product with a stock quantity of zero is considered 'Out of Stock'.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API (Vendor & Catalog service) when fetching product data and frontend when rendering UI.', 'violation_handling': 'The system prevents the item from being added to the cart.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-005

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The system must first be able to determine and display the stock status of a product before it can enforce rules based on that status.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-016

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The basic functionality to add an available item to the cart must exist before the logic to prevent adding an unavailable item can be implemented.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The ability for a vendor to add a product with a specific stock quantity is required to create the 'Out of Stock' state for testing.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The `Vendor & Catalog` microservice's product API must expose a `stockStatus` field or a `stockQuantity` field.
- The frontend application's state management must handle product inventory status.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The `products` data model must include a numerical stock quantity.
- Test data must exist for products with a stock quantity of 0, 1, and >1.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The stock status check must be included in the initial data fetch for product lists and should not introduce additional latency to page load.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All stock validation must be enforced on the server-side (backend API) to prevent client-side manipulation of requests.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The disabled state and 'Out of Stock' label must be immediately clear to the user, preventing confusion.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for disabled controls and status indicators.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard e-commerce functionality.
- Requires conditional rendering on the frontend.
- Requires robust validation on the backend 'Add to Cart' endpoint.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if server-side validation is not atomic. The stock check and update must be handled carefully, possibly within a database transaction.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend (React Native App) must integrate with the `Vendor & Catalog` service API to get product data.
- Frontend must integrate with the `Order Management` service's 'Add to Cart' API endpoint.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify UI for a product with zero stock.
- Verify UI for a product with positive stock.
- Attempt to add an out-of-stock item and verify failure.
- Successfully add an in-stock item.
- Simulate a race condition where stock depletes just before adding to cart.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A vendor account with multiple products.
- At least one product with `stock_quantity = 0`.
- At least one product with `stock_quantity = 1` (for race condition testing).
- At least one product with `stock_quantity > 1`.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest and React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Cypress (or equivalent for mobile like Appium/Detox) for E2E tests.
- Postman or an equivalent tool for API integration testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit tests are written for frontend components and backend logic, achieving >= 80% coverage.
- Integration tests for the 'Add to Cart' API endpoint are implemented and passing.
- Automated E2E tests for the user flow are created and passing.
- UI correctly renders the disabled state on supported devices.
- Accessibility requirements for the disabled button have been verified with a screen reader.
- Backend validation is confirmed to be secure and prevents adding out-of-stock items.
- Story has been demonstrated to the Product Owner and accepted.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational feature for the cart and ordering flow. It should be prioritized early in the development of the customer-facing application.
- Depends on the product data model being finalized.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Critical for the initial launch. Launching without this feature would lead to a very poor user experience and operational issues.
