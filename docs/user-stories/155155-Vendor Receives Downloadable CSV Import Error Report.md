# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

CSV upload with invalid rows triggers error report generation

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A vendor is on the 'Bulk Import Products' page and has selected a CSV file to upload

### 3.1.5 When

The vendor uploads the CSV file, and the system's validation process finds at least one row with an error (e.g., missing required field, invalid data type)

### 3.1.6 Then

The system must NOT import any data from the file, ensuring the import is an atomic operation. The UI must display a clear failure message, such as 'Import failed. We found errors in [X] rows.' A button or link labeled 'Download Error Report (.csv)' must be displayed.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no new products are added to the vendor's catalog. Check for the presence and functionality of the download link.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error report contains only failed rows and a new error description column

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

A vendor has received a failure message after a CSV import attempt

### 3.2.5 When

The vendor clicks the 'Download Error Report (.csv)' link

### 3.2.6 Then

A CSV file is downloaded to the vendor's device. The downloaded file must contain ONLY the rows that failed validation. The file must include all the original columns and data from the failed rows. The file must contain a new, final column named 'Error_Description' which details the specific validation error(s) for that row.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the downloaded CSV. Confirm it only contains the rows that were intentionally made invalid in the test file. Verify the 'Error_Description' column exists and its content is accurate.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error description for a single error in a row is clear and specific

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

A vendor uploads a CSV where a single row is missing the 'price'

### 3.3.5 When

The vendor downloads the corresponding error report

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'Error_Description' column for that row must contain a specific message, such as 'Price is a required field and cannot be empty.'

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test with various single-error types: missing name, non-numeric price, negative stock quantity, etc., and verify the error message is contextually correct.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Error description for multiple errors in a single row is comprehensive

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A vendor uploads a CSV where a single row is missing the 'price' AND has a non-numeric 'stock_quantity'

### 3.4.5 When

The vendor downloads the corresponding error report

### 3.4.6 Then

The 'Error_Description' column for that row must contain a concatenated message detailing all errors, such as 'Price is a required field and cannot be empty; Stock Quantity must be a whole number.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Create a test CSV row with 2-3 distinct errors and verify that all are reported in the error description, separated by a clear delimiter like a semicolon.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System handles file-level errors gracefully

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A vendor is on the 'Bulk Import Products' page

### 3.5.5 When

The vendor uploads a CSV file with incorrect or missing headers

### 3.5.6 Then

The system should display a file-level error message, such as 'Import failed: CSV headers are incorrect. Expected headers are: [name, description, price, stock_quantity, ...].' The system should NOT generate a row-by-row error report in this case.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Test by uploading a CSV with a misspelled header or a missing required header. Verify the specific file-level error is shown and no download link for a row report is offered.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- File upload component (from VND-013)
- Status message area (to display success or failure)
- Download button/link for the error report, which only appears on failure

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User uploads file.
- System processes file (UI should show a loading/processing state).
- UI updates with a clear failure message and a call-to-action to download the report.
- User clicks the download button, which initiates a file download in the browser.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The failure message must state the number of rows that contain errors.
- The download button must clearly indicate it's for an error report and specify the file type (.csv).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The status message (success/failure) must be conveyed to screen readers using ARIA live regions.
- The download button must be keyboard-focusable and have a descriptive aria-label.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-VND-IMPORT-01', 'rule_description': 'CSV imports must be atomic. If one or more rows fail validation, the entire import operation must be rolled back, and no data from the file should be persisted.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend service, after file validation and before database commit.', 'violation_handling': 'The system triggers the error report generation process instead of committing data to the database.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'VND-013', 'dependency_reason': 'This story implements the failure path for the bulk import functionality defined in VND-013. The validation rules (e.g., required columns, data types) that trigger the errors are defined in VND-013.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Backend service capable of parsing CSV files.
- A defined and versioned CSV schema for products.
- Object storage service (e.g., AWS S3) to temporarily store the generated error report.
- Mechanism to generate secure, time-limited download links (e.g., S3 pre-signed URLs).

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- The set of validation rules for product data fields (name, price, stock, etc.) must be finalized.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- For a CSV file of up to 5,000 rows, the validation process and error report generation should complete within 30 seconds.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The download link for the error report must be a secure, time-limited URL (e.g., valid for 1 hour) to prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive product data.
- The uploaded CSV file and the generated error report must be deleted from temporary storage after a short period (e.g., 24 hours).

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Error messages in the report must be human-readable and clearly explain the required correction (e.g., 'Price must be a number' instead of 'DataTypeMismatch: float expected').

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all UI elements.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The generated CSV report must be correctly formatted to open without issues in common spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- File I/O and parsing logic.
- Implementation of a robust, row-by-row validation engine.
- Logic for aggregating multiple errors for a single row.
- Generation of a new CSV file on the fly.
- Integration with cloud storage (S3) for temporary file hosting and secure URL generation.
- Potential need for an asynchronous job queue (e.g., SQS) to handle large file processing without blocking the main application thread.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation when processing very large CSV files.
- Character encoding issues in uploaded or generated CSV files.
- Ensuring the atomicity of the import operation, especially under load or in case of system failure during processing.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Vendor Web Dashboard Frontend.
- Catalog Management Microservice (Backend).
- AWS S3 for file storage.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Upload a CSV with a single invalid row (missing required field).
- Upload a CSV with a single invalid row (incorrect data type).
- Upload a CSV with a row containing multiple distinct errors.
- Upload a CSV with multiple invalid rows, each with different errors.
- Upload a CSV with incorrect headers.
- Upload a perfectly valid CSV to ensure this error-handling logic is NOT triggered.
- E2E test: Vendor logs in, uploads an invalid CSV, verifies the UI message, downloads the report, and inspects its contents for correctness.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A suite of invalid CSV files, each designed to trigger specific validation rules and scenarios listed above.
- A baseline valid CSV file.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for unit/integration tests on the backend.
- Cypress for end-to-end testing of the user flow.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing.
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer.
- Unit and integration tests are written for the validation logic and report generation, achieving >= 80% code coverage.
- End-to-end automated test for the primary failure scenario is implemented and passing.
- The UI for failure notification and download is reviewed and approved by the design team.
- The format of the downloaded error report CSV has been verified.
- Security requirements for temporary file storage and download links are implemented and verified.
- Documentation for the CSV import format, including all validation rules, is updated.
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story should be developed in the same sprint as or immediately following VND-013, as they are functionally coupled.
- The final list of validation rules from VND-013 must be available before starting development.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Critical for a usable bulk import feature. Launching the import feature without this error-handling story would lead to a poor vendor experience and high support load.
