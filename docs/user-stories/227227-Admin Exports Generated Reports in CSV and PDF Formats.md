I am an Administrator logged into the admin dashboard and viewing a report with data

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Export' button and select the 'Export as PDF' option

### 3.2.6 Then

The system generates a well-formatted PDF document containing the report data, and the browser initiates a file download.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the PDF includes a report title, the date of generation, a summary of applied filters, and the data presented in a clean, readable table. Check that pagination is handled correctly for multi-page reports. The filename should follow the convention: '[ReportName]_[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf'.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempt to export a report with no data

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am viewing a report where the current filters result in no data being displayed

### 3.3.5 When

I attempt to click the 'Export' button

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'Export' button should be disabled, or if enabled, clicking it should display a message like 'There is no data to export.' No file should be generated or downloaded.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Apply filters to a report to ensure no results are returned. Confirm the export functionality is appropriately restricted and provides clear user feedback.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Exporting a large report shows processing feedback

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

I am viewing a report with a large dataset (e.g., over 5,000 rows)

### 3.4.5 When

I initiate an export to either CSV or PDF

### 3.4.6 Then

The UI must display a non-blocking loading indicator (e.g., a toast notification saying 'Your report is being generated...') to inform me that the process has started, and I should be notified when the download is ready.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test with a large, seeded dataset. The export should be handled asynchronously to prevent UI freezing or request timeouts. The user should receive a notification when the file is ready to be downloaded.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System handles a report generation failure gracefully

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

I have initiated a report export

### 3.5.5 When

an unexpected error occurs on the backend during file generation

### 3.5.6 Then

The system must display a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'An error occurred while generating your report. Please try again.') and the operation should fail without crashing the application.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a backend failure for the export endpoint. Verify that the frontend catches the error and displays the appropriate message to the user.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Export' button on each report page.
- A dropdown menu or similar control to select the export format (CSV, PDF).
- A non-blocking loading indicator/toast notification for in-progress exports.
- An error notification component for failed exports.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Export' reveals format options.
- Selecting a format triggers the file generation and download process.
- The user can continue to interact with the application while a large export is being processed in the background.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- PDF exports must include a header with the report title, generation date, and applied filters.
- CSV exports must use UTF-8 encoding to support all character sets.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Export' button and its options must be keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA labels.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Exported filenames must follow the format: '[ReportName]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[extension]'. For example, 'Sales_Report_2025-01-24.csv'.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend file generation service.', 'violation_handling': 'This is a system-enforced rule; no user violation is possible.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'ADM-026', 'dependency_reason': 'This story provides the export functionality for reports. The reports themselves must exist before they can be exported.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A server-side library for CSV generation (e.g., 'fast-csv' for Node.js).
- A server-side library for PDF generation (e.g., 'Puppeteer' for rendering a web page to PDF, or 'pdf-lib').
- An asynchronous job queue system (e.g., AWS SQS) for handling large exports without timing out.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the data sources and query logic used by the reports defined in ADM-026.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- For reports under 1,000 rows, file generation and download initiation should take less than 10 seconds.
- For larger reports, the asynchronous job should be queued within 2 seconds of the user's request.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The export endpoint must be protected and only accessible by authenticated users with the 'Administrator' role.
- Generated files should be stored temporarily and securely, with access expiring shortly after generation, and then be deleted.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The export process should be intuitive and provide clear feedback to the user regarding its status (in-progress, success, failure).

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- UI components must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The export functionality must work on all supported modern web browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Implementing a robust PDF generation service that handles formatting, headers, and pagination correctly.
- Setting up an asynchronous background job queue to handle large exports to prevent API timeouts and UI blocking.
- Ensuring consistent data between the on-screen report and the exported file, especially when filters are applied.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation if large file generation is not handled asynchronously.
- Formatting issues in PDF exports across different types of report data.
- Memory consumption on the server during the generation of very large files.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The reporting module's data retrieval service.
- The asynchronous job processing system (e.g., SQS worker).
- The user notification system (to signal completion of large exports).

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements
