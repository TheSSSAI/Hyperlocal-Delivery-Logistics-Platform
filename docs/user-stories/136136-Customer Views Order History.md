- Loading indicator (spinner)
- Empty state message and graphic
- Error message with a 'Retry' button
- Back navigation button from the detail view

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping an order in the list navigates to its detail view.
- Scrolling the list triggers loading of more items (infinite scroll).
- Tapping 'Retry' on an error screen re-attempts the data fetch.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Order list must be sorted by date, descending.
- Order summary must show Vendor Name, Date, Total Amount, Status.
- Order detail must show a complete breakdown of the order.
- Currency must be displayed in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) as per REQ-INT-005.
- Dates and times must be in IST as per REQ-INT-005.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All interactive elements (list items, buttons) must have clear labels for screen readers.
- Text must have sufficient contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (REQ-INT-001).
- The list should be navigable using accessibility controls.

- Implementing robust client-side caching for offline support adds complexity.
- API design for pagination must be solid to ensure good performance and user experience.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A poorly optimized database query could lead to slow API response times as the number of orders grows.
- Inconsistent data between the cache and the server could lead to a confusing user experience if not managed properly.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Mobile client integrates with the 'Order Management' service API.
