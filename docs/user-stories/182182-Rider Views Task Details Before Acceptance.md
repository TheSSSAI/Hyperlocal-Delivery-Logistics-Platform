# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Rider receives and views a new task offer

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a Rider is logged in, has their status set to 'Online', and is available for tasks

### 3.1.5 When

the system pushes a new delivery task offer to the Rider's application

### 3.1.6 Then

a full-screen modal or dedicated screen shall appear, overlaying any current view.

### 3.1.7 And

a prominent 'Reject' button shall be displayed and enabled.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify all data points are present and correctly formatted. The map should be interactive (zoom/pan). The timer should decrement visibly each second.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Rider lets the offer timer expire

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

a Rider is viewing a new task offer on their screen

### 3.2.5 When

the countdown timer reaches zero before the Rider taps 'Accept' or 'Reject'

### 3.2.6 Then

the task offer screen shall automatically be dismissed.

### 3.2.7 And

the Rider's status shall remain 'Online' and available for the next task.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Confirm that the view disappears at T-0 and the backend logs a timeout rejection, triggering re-assignment (as per SYS-002).

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Mapping service fails to provide route details

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

the system attempts to generate a task offer for a Rider

### 3.3.5 When

the backend fails to retrieve route, distance, or time information from the external mapping service (e.g., Mapbox API)

### 3.3.6 Then

the task offer shall not be sent to the Rider.

### 3.3.7 And

the system shall log the API failure and immediately attempt to find another rider for the task.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

This is primarily a backend validation. The rider should not receive a broken or incomplete offer. This prevents riders from accepting tasks with unknown parameters.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Alternative Flow: Rider goes offline while viewing an offer

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

a Rider is viewing a new task offer on their screen

### 3.4.5 When

the Rider manually toggles their status to 'Offline'

### 3.4.6 Then

the task offer screen shall be immediately dismissed.

### 3.4.7 And

the system shall treat this as a rejection.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Verify that changing availability status immediately cancels any pending offers for that rider.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Full-screen modal/view for the task offer
- Map view component (e.g., Mapbox SDK)
- Text labels for Vendor Name, Vendor Address, Customer Address, Distance, Time, Earnings
- Countdown timer display (e.g., circular progress bar or numeric countdown)
- Large, easily tappable 'Accept' button
- Large, easily tappable 'Reject' button

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The offer should appear with a distinct sound and/or vibration to alert the rider.
- The map should allow basic pan and zoom gestures.
- Tapping 'Accept' proceeds to the next step in the delivery flow (RDR-012).
- Tapping 'Reject' dismisses the modal and makes the rider available again (RDR-013).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Information must be presented with high contrast and large, legible fonts for readability in various lighting conditions (e.g., bright sunlight).
- The 'Accept' button should be visually distinct, perhaps as the primary action (e.g., solid green).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and interactive elements must have accessible labels for screen readers.
- Text should respect the device's font size settings.
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-RDR-01', 'rule_description': 'A rider has a limited, administrator-configured amount of time to accept or reject a task offer.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend and Rider Application', 'violation_handling': 'If the timer expires, the offer is automatically rejected, and the task is re-assigned to the next available rider (Ref: REQ-FUN-013, SYS-002).'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

RDR-009

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Rider must be able to set status to 'Online' to be eligible for task offers.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

RDR-010

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system mechanism (Push Notification/WebSocket) for sending an offer to the rider's device must be in place.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

ADM-016

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The value for the acceptance countdown timer is configured by an administrator.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

VND-021

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The task offer is triggered when a vendor marks an order as 'Ready for Pickup'.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Rider Logistics microservice for task allocation logic.
- Real-time communication channel (WebSocket or Push Notification service like FCM).
- Mobile application's native map SDK (e.g., Mapbox).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Validated vendor and customer address data.
- Calculated earnings for the specific delivery task.
- Configuration data for the acceptance timer.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Mapbox API (or equivalent) for providing route, distance, and real-time traffic-aware travel time estimates.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The latency from the backend triggering the offer to the UI being displayed on the rider's device shall be less than 2 seconds.
- The backend API call to fetch task details, including the external mapping service call, must have a P95 latency of under 800ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Customer PII (address) must be transmitted over a secure (HTTPS/WSS) channel.
- Access to this information is limited to the assigned rider for the duration of the active task.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The offer screen must be glanceable, allowing a rider to assess the key details within 5-10 seconds.
- Interaction targets ('Accept'/'Reject' buttons) must be large enough for easy use in a mobile context.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on supported iOS and Android versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Integration with a real-time communication service (WebSocket/FCM) for instant offer delivery.
- Backend dependency on a third-party mapping API, which introduces external latency and a potential point of failure.
- Complex UI combining static data, a countdown timer, and an interactive map on a single screen.
- Client-side state management to handle the offer lifecycle (pending, accepted, rejected, timed_out) gracefully, especially under poor network conditions.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- High latency or failure of the external mapping API could prevent offers from being made, creating a bottleneck in the system.
- Reliability of push notifications or WebSocket connections across different mobile device manufacturers and OS versions.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend: Rider Logistics service receives the 'Ready for Pickup' event and calls the Mapping service.
- Backend: Pushes the compiled offer data via the Notification service.
- Mobile App: Receives the push/WebSocket message and renders the UI.
- Mobile App: Calls the Rider Logistics service API to accept or reject the task.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story for the entire delivery execution flow. It is a dependency for subsequent rider stories like navigation and status updates.
- Requires coordinated effort between backend (logistics, API), frontend (mobile UI), and DevOps (real-time infrastructure).

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is critical for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch. The platform cannot function without riders being able to view and accept tasks.
