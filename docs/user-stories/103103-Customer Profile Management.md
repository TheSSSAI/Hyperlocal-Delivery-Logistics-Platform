I navigate to the 'My Profile' screen

### 3.1.6 Then

I should see my current Name, Email, and registered Mobile Number displayed.

### 3.1.7 And

An 'Edit' button or icon is clearly visible.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

I tap the 'Edit' button to enter edit mode

### 3.2.6 And

A notification (push or SMS) is triggered to my device confirming the change, as per REQ-FUN-003.

### 3.2.7 Then

The system validates and saves the new information to my profile.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Check the database to confirm the user's record is updated. Verify that the notification is sent via the appropriate service (FCM/SNS).

### 3.3.6 And

The screen remains in edit mode.

### 3.3.7 Then

The system must not save the changes.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

The system must discard all unsaved changes.

### 3.5.7 And

The profile screen returns to view mode, displaying the original, unchanged information.

I submit a valid profile update request

### 3.6.6 Then

The API response (success or failure) should be received in under 200ms for the 95th percentile of requests, as per REQ-NFR-001.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Text labels for 'Name', 'Email', 'Mobile Number'
- Display fields for user's current data

- An 'Edit' button/icon to enter edit mode
- A 'Save' button to confirm changes
- A 'Cancel' button or back navigation to discard changes
- A success toast/snackbar for confirmation
- Inline error message display areas for validation

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping 'Edit' enables input fields and shows 'Save'/'Cancel' buttons.
- Tapping 'Save' triggers validation and an API call.
- Tapping 'Cancel' reverts the UI to its pre-edit state.
- Input fields should have clear focus indicators.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The user's full name, email, and mobile number must be clearly displayed.
- The mobile number must be visually indicated as non-editable.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All input fields must have associated labels for screen readers.
- Buttons must have accessible names (e.g., 'Edit profile').
- Sufficient color contrast must be used for text and UI elements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (REQ-INT-001).

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-001

A user account must be created before a profile can be managed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

CUS-003

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The user must be able to log in and have an active session to access their profile.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- API Gateway to expose the profile update endpoint.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an existing user record in the database.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The P95 latency for the profile update API endpoint must be under 200ms (REQ-NFR-001).
- The profile screen on the mobile app should load in under 1.5 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require a valid JWT.
- The system must enforce that a user can only view and modify their own profile data (Authorization).
- All data must be transmitted over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ (REQ-INT-004).
- Input data must be sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks (OWASP Top 10).

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard CRUD operation with a simple form UI.
- Requires integration with existing authentication and notification services.
- Decision on where PII is mastered (Cognito vs. application DB) needs to be finalized.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential latency in the notification service could delay the confirmation alert, which should be handled asynchronously to not block the UI response.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend 'Identity & Access' microservice API (e.g., PUT /api/v1/users/me/profile).
- Asynchronous event publishing to a message queue (e.g., AWS SQS) for the notification service to consume.
