# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly visible 'Filter' button on the search results screen, possibly with a count of active filters (e.g., 'Filter (2)').
- A filter interface (e.g., bottom sheet or full-screen modal) that organizes filters by type: Category, Rating, Price Range.
- Checkboxes or selectable tags for multi-select categories.
- Selectable star rating options (e.g., '4 Stars & Up', '3 Stars & Up').
- Selectable price range options (e.g., '$', '$$', '$$$').
- An 'Apply Filters' button to confirm selections.
- A 'Clear All' or 'Reset' button to remove all selections.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the 'Filter' button opens the filter interface.
- Users can select multiple options within a filter type (if applicable, e.g., multiple categories) and across different filter types.
- Applying filters should dismiss the filter interface and update the underlying search results list.
- The system should provide immediate visual feedback when a filter option is selected or deselected.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The search results page must clearly indicate which filters are currently active.
- When no results are found due to filtering, a specific message must be displayed instead of an empty list.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All filter controls must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
- Controls must have appropriate labels for screen readers (e.g., 'Filter by 4 stars and up').
- The filter interface must be fully navigable using keyboard or assistive technologies.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

*No items available*

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

CUS-011

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story enhances the search results page, which must be implemented first.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-008

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor-defined product categories are required as a data source for the 'Category' filter.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

CUS-037

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Customer ratings for vendors must be collected and aggregated to enable the 'Rating' filter.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend search API endpoint capable of accepting and processing filter parameters for category, rating, and price.
- A search index (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch as per REQ-TEC-001) with correctly indexed fields for filtering.
- Frontend state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit as per REQ-TEC-001) to handle filter state and data fetching.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Availability of structured data for vendor/product categories.
- Aggregated average rating for each vendor.
- A defined price range classification for items or vendors.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The 95th percentile (P95) latency for API calls to fetch filtered results must be under 500ms, consistent with REQ-FUN-004.
- The client-side UI update after receiving filtered data should be visually instantaneous (<100ms).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All filter parameters sent to the backend must be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The filter mechanism should be intuitive and require minimal taps to apply and clear filters.
- The state of applied filters must be clearly and persistently visible to the user on the results screen.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported mobile OS versions.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend implementation requires efficient query construction for the search service (e.g., OpenSearch) to handle multiple combined filters without performance degradation.
- Frontend implementation requires careful state management for active filters, search results, and pagination.
- Defining and populating the 'price range' data point for all vendors/items requires a clear business rule and potential data backfilling.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poorly constructed search queries could lead to slow API response times, violating performance requirements.
- Inconsistent or missing data for categories or ratings could make the filters unreliable.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend mobile application's search results screen.
- Backend search microservice and its API.
- Amazon OpenSearch Service for data indexing and querying.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify filtering with multiple criteria from different types (e.g., Category + Rating).
- Verify clearing filters restores the original result set.
- Verify the 'no results' message appears correctly.
- Verify filter state persists on navigation (back/forward).
- Verify performance of the filter API call under simulated load.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of vendors and products with diverse categories, ratings (from 1 to 5), and price points.
- At least one search term that returns a large number of results to test performance.
- A specific filter combination that is known to return zero results.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
