# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Successful payment using an online method

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a customer on the payment selection screen with a valid order total

### 3.1.5 When

I select an online payment method (e.g., UPI) and initiate the payment

### 3.1.6 Then

The system must perform a final real-time inventory check for all items in my cart. If successful, I am redirected to the Razorpay payment interface. After I successfully authorize the payment, I am redirected back to the app and see a 'Payment Successful' confirmation screen with my order ID. The order's status in the backend is updated to 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify using Razorpay's test environment. Check the order status in the database and the creation of a corresponding transaction record.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Payment declined by the payment gateway

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am on the Razorpay payment interface

### 3.2.5 When

I enter invalid details or my bank declines the transaction

### 3.2.6 Then

I am redirected back to the app's payment selection screen. A clear, user-friendly error message is displayed, such as 'Your payment failed. Please try again or use a different payment method.' The order is not created in the system.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Use Razorpay's test cards that simulate payment failure. Verify that no order record is created in the 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' state.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Alternative Flow: User cancels payment on the gateway page

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

I have been redirected to the Razorpay payment interface

### 3.3.5 When

I press the back button or explicitly cancel the transaction

### 3.3.6 Then

I am returned to the app's payment selection screen. No order is created, and my cart remains intact.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Manually cancel a transaction in the Razorpay test environment and verify the app's state.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Item becomes out of stock just before payment initiation

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am on the payment selection screen and about to pay

### 3.4.5 When

I initiate the payment, and the system's final real-time inventory check finds an item in my cart is now unavailable

### 3.4.6 Then

The payment process is immediately halted before redirecting to the gateway. I am shown a notification identifying the out-of-stock item and am prompted to update my cart.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Manually update the stock of an item in the cart to zero in the database, then attempt to pay for it. Verify the correct message is shown and payment is blocked.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System Resilience: Payment gateway callback is delayed or fails

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

I have successfully authorized a payment on the gateway, but the confirmation webhook to the platform fails

### 3.5.5 When

I am redirected back to the app

### 3.5.6 Then

The app displays an intermediate status like 'Confirming your payment...'. The order in the backend is placed in a 'payment_pending_confirmation' state. A scheduled reconciliation job must later query the gateway's API, confirm the payment status, and update the order to 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This requires backend testing. Simulate a failed callback by temporarily blocking the webhook endpoint. Verify the order enters the pending confirmation state and that the reconciliation job correctly updates it later.

- User is redirected to an external (or in-app browser) view for payment.
- User is automatically redirected back to the app upon payment completion, cancellation, or failure.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The final, all-inclusive order total must be clearly displayed.
- The success screen must confirm the order has been placed.
- Error messages must be clear and suggest a next action.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-PAY-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A final, real-time availability check for all cart items must be performed before initiating a payment transaction. (Ref: REQ-FUN-007)

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend, upon receiving the 'initiate payment' request from the client.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The transaction is halted, and the user is notified with an option to update their cart.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-PAY-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

If a payment confirmation callback from the gateway fails, the order must be placed in a 'payment_pending_confirmation' state to be reconciled by a scheduled job. (Ref: REQ-FUN-007)

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend payment service, when handling gateway webhooks.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The system logs the failed callback and relies on the reconciliation job to prevent a lost order.
