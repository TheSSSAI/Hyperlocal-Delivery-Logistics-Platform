# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated card or section within the 'Earnings' tab of the rider application.
- A large, legible text element to display the monetary value.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The value is display-only; no direct user interaction with the total itself is required for this story.
- The screen should support a pull-to-refresh gesture to manually sync the latest value.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The value must be clearly labeled as 'Cash-in-Hand' or a similarly unambiguous term.
- The amount must be formatted as Indian Rupees (â‚¹) with two decimal places (e.g., â‚¹1,234.50).
- A visual indicator for stale/offline data must be present when the app cannot sync with the backend.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The displayed total must be readable by screen readers, announcing the label and the full currency amount.
- Sufficient color contrast must be used for the text and its background to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-RDR-CIH-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The 'Cash-in-Hand' total must only include the value of completed orders with the 'Cash on Delivery' (COD) payment method.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend calculation logic within the Payments & Settlements service.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Any non-COD order value must be excluded from the sum. This is a system logic constraint.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-RDR-CIH-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The 'Cash-in-Hand' total is cumulative and only decreases upon a confirmed cash remittance event.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend rider ledger within the Payments & Settlements service.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The balance cannot be manually edited by the rider. Changes are event-driven (delivery completion, remittance confirmation).

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

RDR-019

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Delivered' status update is the trigger event for adding an order's value to the Cash-in-Hand total.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

RDR-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story establishes that the COD amount for an order is known and accessible to the system and rider.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

RDR-025

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The cash remittance process is required to reset or decrease the Cash-in-Hand total, providing the full lifecycle for this balance.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The 'Payments & Settlements' microservice must exist to manage the rider's financial ledger.
- The Order Management service must publish an event (e.g., via SQS/SNS) upon order completion that includes the order ID, final amount, and payment method.
- A real-time communication channel (WebSocket or push notification) to inform the client app of updates, or a dedicated API endpoint for the app to poll.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the final, authoritative order details, including total amount and payment method.
- A persistent, transaction-safe data store (e.g., a ledger table in PostgreSQL) to track each rider's COD collections and remittances.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint to fetch the Cash-in-Hand total must respond with P95 latency under 200ms.
- The UI on the rider's app must reflect the updated total within 2 seconds of an order being marked 'Delivered'.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for fetching financial data must be secured and only accessible by the authenticated rider to whom the data belongs.
- All financial data must be transmitted over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The information must be presented clearly and concisely, requiring minimal cognitive load from a rider who may be on the move.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported versions of iOS and Android for the React Native application.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires careful design of a financial ledger system to ensure accuracy and auditability.
- The need for atomic updates: marking an order delivered and updating the rider's balance must succeed or fail together.
- Handling state management and data synchronization between the backend and the mobile client, especially in offline scenarios.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Race conditions or calculation errors could lead to incorrect financial data, damaging rider trust.
- Delays in the event-driven architecture could cause a noticeable lag in the UI update.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Subscribes to events from the 'Order Management' service.
- Provides data to the 'Rider' mobile application via a REST API.
- Will need to integrate with the future 'Cash Remittance' feature logic.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- A set of test orders with both COD and prepaid payment methods.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
