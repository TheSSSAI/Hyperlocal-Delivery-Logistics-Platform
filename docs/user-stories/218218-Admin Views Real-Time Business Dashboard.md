# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Dashboard displays all key metric widgets on successful load

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an authenticated Administrator and have navigated to the admin dashboard

### 3.1.5 When

the dashboard page finishes loading

### 3.1.6 Then

I should see distinct widgets for: 'Orders per Minute', 'Total Orders (Today)', 'Total GMV (Today)', 'Rider Allocation Success Rate (%)', 'Average Delivery Time (minutes)', 'Payment Success Rate (%)', 'Active Riders', and 'Active Vendors'.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that all 8 specified widgets are rendered with numerical or percentage values. 'Today' refers to the current calendar day in IST.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Dashboard data auto-refreshes periodically

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am viewing the admin dashboard

### 3.2.5 When

I remain on the page for 30 seconds without any interaction

### 3.2.6 Then

the data within the widgets should update automatically to reflect the latest metrics without requiring a full page reload.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to observe network requests being made at a regular interval (e.g., 30s). The displayed values should change if new data is available.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Dashboard handles data source unavailability for a single widget

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am an authenticated Administrator

### 3.3.5 And

all other widgets for which data is available should load and display their metrics correctly.

### 3.3.6 When

I load the admin dashboard

### 3.3.7 Then

the 'Active Riders' widget should display a clear error state (e.g., 'Data unavailable') without crashing the page.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Simulate a service failure for one of the data points in a testing environment. The UI should degrade gracefully.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.5 When

I load the admin dashboard

### 3.4.6 Then

the 'Total Orders (Today)' and 'Total GMV (Today)' widgets should display '0'.

### 3.4.7 And

metrics like 'Average Delivery Time' should display 'N/A' or a similar indicator if there is no data to compute an average.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Test against a dataset with no activity for the current day. The UI must not show broken elements or 'NaN' errors.

### 3.6.6 Then

each metric should be presented in a visually clear format, such as a scorecard for single numbers and a simple line chart for time-series data like 'Orders per Minute'.

### 3.6.7 And

all text and chart colors must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All monetary values (GMV) must be displayed in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) format.
- Time-based metrics ('Today') must be calculated based on the IST timezone.
- Data refresh interval should be clearly understood, ideally between 15-30 seconds.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.
- Sufficient color contrast for all text and data visualizations.
- Keyboard navigability between widgets.
