- Access to the 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice.
- Access to rating data from the relevant data store.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing vendor records in the database with profile information, business hours, and product catalogs.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Product images are served from an external CDN (e.g., AWS S3 via CloudFront).

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- API aggregation: The backend needs to efficiently gather data from multiple sources (vendor profile, products, categories, ratings) into a single response.
- Frontend state management: The client needs to handle the state for vendor data, a potentially large and paginated product list, and the search filter.
- UI performance: Ensuring a smooth scrolling experience for a catalog with hundreds of items requires careful implementation (e.g., list virtualization).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The vendor profile API could become a bottleneck if not properly optimized with caching and efficient database queries.
- Poorly optimized images could significantly slow down page load times.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points
