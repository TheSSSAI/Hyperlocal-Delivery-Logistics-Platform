# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Product with ample stock displays 'Available'

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a vendor has set a product's stock quantity to 20, and the 'Limited Stock' threshold is 5

### 3.1.5 When

a customer views the product on a listing page or the product detail page

### 3.1.6 Then

the system must display the stock status as 'Available'.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI shows a text label 'Available'. A green color indicator is recommended but not sufficient on its own.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Product with low stock displays 'Limited Stock'

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a vendor has set a product's stock quantity to 5, and the 'Limited Stock' threshold is 5

### 3.2.5 When

a customer views the product listing

### 3.2.6 Then

the system must display the stock status as 'Limited Stock'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI shows a text label 'Limited Stock'. An orange/amber color indicator is recommended.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Product with zero stock displays 'Out of Stock'

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a vendor has set a product's stock quantity to 0

### 3.3.5 When

a customer views the product listing

### 3.3.6 Then

the system must display the stock status as 'Out of Stock'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI shows a text label 'Out of Stock'. A red color indicator is recommended. The 'Add to Cart' button should be disabled as per CUS-015.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System uses default threshold when vendor has not set one

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a vendor has set a product's stock quantity to 4

### 3.4.5 And

the system has a default 'Limited Stock' threshold of 5

### 3.4.6 When

a customer views the product listing

### 3.4.7 Then

the system must display the stock status as 'Limited Stock'.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Requires a system-level default configuration for the threshold. Test by ensuring a product with a null threshold value still correctly evaluates the status.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Product with negative stock is treated as 'Out of Stock'

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

due to a data anomaly, a product's stock quantity is -1

### 3.5.5 When

a customer views the product listing

### 3.5.6 Then

the system must display the stock status as 'Out of Stock'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The backend logic should treat any quantity less than or equal to 0 as 'Out of Stock'.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A text label for displaying the stock status.
- Optional: A color-coded icon or background for the text label to provide a quick visual cue (e.g., Green for Available, Orange for Limited, Red for Out of Stock).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The stock status is a read-only display element; no direct user interaction is required.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The stock status must be visible on product cards in list views (e.g., search results, category pages).
- The stock status must be clearly visible on the product detail page.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- If color is used to indicate status, it must be accompanied by a clear text label to comply with WCAG 2.1 for color blindness.
- The text label must have sufficient color contrast against its background.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-STOCK-01', 'rule_description': "Stock status is determined by the numerical stock quantity against a configurable threshold. Statuses are 'Available', 'Limited Stock', and 'Out of Stock'.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API when serializing product data for client consumption.', 'violation_handling': 'N/A. This is a data derivation rule.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

VND-009

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story depends on the vendor's ability to set a numerical stock quantity for a product.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

VND-012

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Limited Stock' status logic requires the vendor's ability to configure a specific threshold. A system default must exist as a fallback.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

CUS-011

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The UI for this story will be implemented on the search results/listing pages created in CUS-011.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The backend 'Vendor & Catalog' service must expose an API endpoint that returns product data including the calculated stock status.
- The `products` table in the database must include `stock_quantity` and `limited_stock_threshold` columns.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires product records with accurate stock quantity data to be present in the database.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The calculation and retrieval of stock status should not add more than 20ms of latency to the product data API response.
- The overall API response for product listings must adhere to the P95 latency of <500ms as defined in REQ-FUN-004.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- No specific security requirements beyond standard API authentication and authorization.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The status must be immediately understandable to the user at a glance.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA, particularly regarding color contrast and not relying on color alone to convey information.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The UI element must render correctly on all supported iOS and Android versions for the React Native app.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend logic is a simple conditional statement.
- Frontend work involves adding a small, reusable UI component.
- Requires coordination between backend (to provide the data) and frontend (to display it).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for performance degradation if the stock status calculation is not optimized for large list queries. The calculation should be done efficiently within the database query if possible.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend: The 'Vendor & Catalog' microservice API.
- Frontend: The product list/grid component and the product detail page component in the customer mobile app.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify correct status for a product with high stock.
- Verify correct status for a product with stock equal to the threshold.
- Verify correct status for a product with stock below the threshold but > 0.
- Verify correct status for a product with zero stock.
- Verify correct status when a vendor-specific threshold is not set and the system default is used.
- Verify UI on both product list and product detail screens.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Products with various stock quantities (high, low, zero, negative).
- Products with and without a custom 'Limited Stock' threshold set.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for backend and frontend unit tests.
- Cypress for E2E testing.
- Accessibility scanning tools (e.g., Axe) for the UI component.
