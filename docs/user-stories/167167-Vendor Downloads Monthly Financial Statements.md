The UI displays a non-technical error message, such as 'We were unable to generate your statement at this time. Please try again later or contact support.'

### 3.7.8 Validation Notes

Simulate a service failure (e.g., by stopping the reporting microservice in a test environment) and verify the frontend response.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A date picker or dropdowns to select Month and Year.
- A 'Download PDF' button.
- A 'Download CSV' button.
- A loading indicator/spinner for asynchronous generation.
- A toast or notification area for success or error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The current month should be disabled in the date picker, as statements are only for completed months.
- Buttons should be disabled while a report is being generated to prevent multiple requests.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The page should clearly be titled 'Financial Statements' or similar.
- The interface should be clean and simple, focusing on the date selection and download actions.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All UI elements (buttons, date pickers) must be keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA labels.
- The generated PDF should be a tagged PDF to improve screen reader compatibility.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-FIN-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Financial statements can only be generated for completed calendar months.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

User Interface (disabling current/future months) and API (validation).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API will return a 400 Bad Request error if a request is made for a non-completed month.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-VND-FIN-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The data in the statement must be sourced from the immutable, double-entry financial ledger to ensure accuracy and auditability, as specified in REQ-FUN-021.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-021

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story is the primary dependency. The financial module with its immutable ledger for transactions, commissions, and payouts must be fully implemented and reliable. This story consumes that data.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

REQ-FUN-017

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The order lifecycle management system must be in place to accurately identify 'Delivered' orders that are eligible for inclusion in financial statements.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

VND-004

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Vendor must be able to log in to the dashboard to access this feature.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend service or library for PDF generation (e.g., Puppeteer, pdf-lib).
- A backend service or library for CSV generation.
- An asynchronous task queue (e.g., AWS SQS) to handle report generation for high-volume vendors without blocking the API.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Read access to the 'Payments & Settlements' microservice's data store, specifically the transaction ledger.
- Read access to the 'Order Management' service to correlate transactions with order details.
- Read access to the 'Vendor & Catalog' service to get store profile information for the statement header.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- For vendors with <1000 transactions/month, statement generation should be near-instant (<5 seconds).
- For high-volume vendors, asynchronous generation must complete within 60 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for downloading statements must be secured and only accessible by the authenticated vendor who owns the data.
- The generated files should not contain any PII of customers beyond what is necessary (e.g., Order ID only, no names or addresses).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process of selecting a month and downloading a report should be achievable in 3 clicks or less from the dashboard homepage.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The vendor dashboard where this feature resides must be functional on all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The need for an asynchronous generation process for scalability.
- Ensuring 100% financial accuracy requires careful data aggregation and validation logic.
- PDF formatting and layout can be complex, especially handling pagination for large reports.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Data discrepancies between the statement and the core ledger could erode vendor trust. This requires extensive testing.
- Performance bottlenecks in the data aggregation query for high-volume vendors.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- The backend for this feature will query the 'Payments & Settlements' service API or database.
- It will likely be a new endpoint within the 'Vendor' or a dedicated 'Reporting' microservice.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify PDF and CSV download for a vendor with a small number of transactions.
- Verify PDF and CSV download for a vendor with zero transactions in a month.
- Verify PDF and CSV download for a vendor with thousands of transactions (performance test).
- Manually verify the financial accuracy of a generated statement by comparing all line items and totals against the database source of truth.
- Test API endpoint security to ensure one vendor cannot access another's statements.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test vendor accounts with varying levels of transaction volume: zero, low (~10), medium (~100), and high (5000+).
- Test data must include completed orders and processed payouts within specific, known date ranges.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Cypress for E2E testing of the download flow.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story has a significant backend component. Ensure backend and frontend developers collaborate early on the API contract.
- The dependency on REQ-FUN-021 is critical; this story cannot be started until that module is stable and provides reliable data.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a high-value feature for vendors and a key part of the financial feature set. It should be included in a major release focused on vendor tools.
