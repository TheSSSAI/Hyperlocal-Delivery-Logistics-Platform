## 2.2.0.0 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### 2.2.1.0 Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### 2.2.2.0 Description

An approach to software development that focuses on modeling the software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. Service boundaries for microservices are defined around these domain models (Bounded Contexts).

### 2.2.3.0 Benefits

### 2.3.3.0 Benefits

- Provides a unified interface for diverse clients (mobile, web) instead of exposing individual microservices.
- Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication (JWT validation) and security policies.
- Simplifies client-side code by abstracting the backend microservice architecture.
- Enables request routing, composition, and protocol translation in one place.

### 2.3.4.0 Tradeoffs

### 2.5.3.0 Benefits

- Maintains data consistency across multiple services without using distributed locking or 2PC.
- Avoids tight coupling between services.
- Each service has atomic control over its own data.
- Enables robust rollback and compensation logic for failed transactions.
