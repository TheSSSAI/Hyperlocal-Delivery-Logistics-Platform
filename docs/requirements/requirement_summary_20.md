The Hyperlocal Delivery & Logistics Platform aims to connect local businesses (shops, restaurants, pharmacies, service providers) with customers in their immediate vicinity using on-demand riders. The core objective is to provide fast delivery, typically within 30 minutes to 2 hours, supporting various product types like groceries, food, medicines, parcels, and documents.

**Key Features:**

*   **Customer App/Web:** Customers can browse nearby stores, view real-time stock, place orders, and track deliveries live. Payments are supported via UPI, cards, and cash on delivery.
*   **Vendor Dashboard:** Vendors can manage inventory, accept/reject orders, and update prices.
*   **Rider Mobile App:** Riders receive pickup/drop-off details, distance, earnings, navigation, and can update delivery status and upload proof of delivery.
*   **Backend & Admin Panel:** Includes order management, route optimization, rider allocation, commission tracking. Admins manage users, vendors, riders, service areas, and generate reports on sales, delivery times, and performance.
*   **Optional Features:** Scheduled deliveries, bulk order handling, loyalty programs, and AI-based demand prediction for efficient rider positioning.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Mobile Apps:** React Native
*   **Web Dashboards (Vendor/Admin):** React.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js or Django
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB
*   **Hosting:** Scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS)
*   **Security:** Data encryption, OTP verification, and secure payment processing.

The platform's strategic goal is to empower local Indian markets, improve delivery efficiency, strengthen community-based commerce, and create flexible earning opportunities for delivery partners.
