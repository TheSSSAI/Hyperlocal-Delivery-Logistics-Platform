# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

- {'pattern_name': 'Component Library / Design System', 'pattern_application': "The repository is structured as a component library, providing a single source of truth for UI elements. It follows Atomic Design principles, where basic 'atoms' (Button, Icon) are composed into 'molecules' (SearchBar, FormGroup) and 'organisms' (OrderCard, RegistrationForm).", 'required_components': ['Storybook for component-driven development and documentation.', 'NPM/Yarn for package management and publishing.'], 'implementation_strategy': "Components are developed in isolation within Storybook. The library is published as a private, versioned NPM package, and client applications consume it as a dependency. This decouples the design system's lifecycle from the applications' release cycles.", 'analysis_reasoning': "This pattern is the industry standard for enforcing UI consistency, improving developer velocity, and ensuring high-quality, reusable code across multiple frontend applications, which directly aligns with the project's requirement for four distinct client apps."}

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

- {'integration_type': 'Code Dependency', 'target_components': ['Customer Mobile App', 'Rider Mobile App', 'Vendor Web Dashboard', 'Administrator Web Dashboard'], 'communication_pattern': 'N/A (Compile-time dependency)', 'interface_requirements': ["The library's public API is its set of exported React/React Native components.", 'The interface contract for each component is its props, which are strictly defined using TypeScript interfaces.'], 'analysis_reasoning': "The library's purpose is to be consumed by other frontend applications. The integration is managed through the package manager, and the contract is enforced at compile time by TypeScript, ensuring type safety and clear usage."}

- {'entity_name': 'N/A', 'database_table': 'N/A', 'required_properties': [], 'relationship_mappings': [], 'access_patterns': [], 'analysis_reasoning': 'This repository is a stateless UI component library. It does not have its own database, does not define domain entities, and does not directly perform data persistence. Its responsibility is purely presentational.'}

## 5.2.0.0.0 Data Access Requirements

- {'operation_type': 'N/A', 'required_methods': [], 'performance_constraints': 'N/A', 'analysis_reasoning': 'The library does not contain a data access layer. All data is passed into components via props from the consuming application, which is responsible for data fetching.'}

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

- {'sequence_name': 'User Interaction Flow', 'repository_role': 'This repository provides the UI building blocks that enable user interaction sequences. It does not orchestrate the sequences themselves.', 'required_interfaces': ["Component Prop Interfaces (e.g., 'IButtonProps', 'IInputProps')"], 'method_specifications': [{'method_name': 'onClick (as a prop)', 'interaction_context': 'When a user interacts with a component (e.g., clicks a Button).', 'parameter_analysis': "Typically a callback function, e.g., '() => void' or '(event: MouseEvent) => void', passed from the parent component.", 'return_type_analysis': "Typically 'void'.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the standard React pattern for handling events. The UI library provides the event-emitting component, and the consuming application provides the business logic to execute in the callback.'}, {'method_name': 'value / children (as props)', 'interaction_context': 'When a parent component needs to render data within a UI component.', 'parameter_analysis': 'Data of various types (string, number, ReactNode) passed from the parent.', 'return_type_analysis': 'N/A', 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the standard React pattern for data flow, where data is passed down the component tree via props.'}], 'analysis_reasoning': "The interaction model is based on standard React principles. The library's components are 'controlled components' where state and behavior are managed by the parent application, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between presentation (this library) and logic (the client apps)."}

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'React Props System', 'implementation_requirements': 'All components must have clearly defined TypeScript interfaces for their props. Data flows down from parent to child, and events are communicated up via callback functions passed as props.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the native communication protocol for React applications and is the correct pattern for a component library to follow.'}
