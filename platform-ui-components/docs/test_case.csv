"TEST-FUNC-E2E-001","Order Placement","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end happy path for a customer placing a prepaid (UPI) order, including vendor acceptance, rider allocation, pickup, and delivery confirmation.","Critical - This is the primary revenue-generating workflow of the platform.","High","Customer, Vendor, and Rider users exist and are active. Vendor is online. Rider is online. Customer has a saved address and payment details.","1. Customer logs in. 2. Searches for a vendor. 3. Adds an item to the cart. 4. Proceeds to checkout and confirms address. 5. Selects UPI payment and completes mock payment. 6. Verifies order confirmation screen. 7. Vendor logs in and accepts the order. 8. Vendor marks order as 'Ready for Pickup'. 9. Rider receives and accepts the task. 10. Rider marks order as 'Picked Up' and then 'Delivered' using OTP.","Order successfully transitions through all states from 'Pending' to 'Delivered'. All parties receive correct notifications. Financial ledgers are updated correctly.","Active Customer, Vendor, Rider accounts. Products with stock > 0.

E2E latency < 60 seconds. All state transitions logged correctly.","Critical - Blocks revenue generation and core business function.","Every release","High","Reset state of users (Vendor/Rider back to 'Online', clear active tasks).","Test data should not use real PII. Session tokens must be managed securely.","Each API call within the flow must meet its specific latency NFR.","N/A for this E2E process test, but individual screens have their own requirements."
"TEST-SEC-API-001","Authentication & Authorization","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user with a 'Customer' role cannot access API endpoints restricted to the 'Administrator' role (e.g., user management).","Critical - Unauthorized access could lead to a major data breach and compromise platform integrity.","Medium","Customer and Administrator accounts exist. A secure admin-only API endpoint exists.","1. Authenticate as a Customer to obtain a valid JWT. 2. Using the Customer JWT, make an API request to an admin-only endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/admin/users). 3. Verify the response.","The API must return a '403 Forbidden' status code. No data should be returned.","Valid JWTs for a Customer and an Administrator.","Postman, Jest (with Supertest)","2","6","1","Identity & Access Service, API Gateway","Integration or Staging environment.","API returns 403 status code for all tested unauthorized role/endpoint combinations.","Critical - Indicates a severe security vulnerability (Broken Access Control).","Every release","Low","N/A","This is a security test itself.

"TEST-PERF-API-001","Product Discovery","Performance","System","High","true","High","Verify that the product search API meets the P95 latency requirement of under 500ms under expected load.","High - Slow search performance leads to poor user experience and high cart abandonment rates.","High","A dedicated performance testing environment exists. The search index (OpenSearch) is populated with a large, realistic dataset.","1. Configure load test script to simulate 100 concurrent users. 2. Ramp up users over 2 minutes. 3. Sustain load for 10 minutes, with each user sending a search query every 5 seconds. 4. Monitor P95 response time, error rate, and throughput.","P95 latency remains below 500ms. Error rate is less than 0.1%. Throughput is stable.","A large search index with >100,000 product documents.","k6, Grafana, Prometheus","8","24","8","Search Service, Amazon OpenSearch","Dedicated, scalable performance testing environment.","P95 Latency < 500ms.

"TEST-INT-001","Payment Processing","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the Payments service correctly handles a failed refund from the payment gateway and moves the order into a 'Refund_Failed' state, triggering an admin alert.","Critical - Failure to handle refunds correctly leads to financial loss and loss of customer trust.","Medium","Payments service is running. A mock payment gateway service is available.","1. Configure the mock gateway to return a 500 error on refund requests. 2. Send an event/API call to the Payments service to initiate a refund for a test order. 3. Verify the service's response. 4. Check the order's status in the test database. 5. Check the message queue for an admin alert event.","The order's transaction status is updated to 'Refund_Failed'. A high-priority alert is published to the admin notifications topic.","A test order with a successful payment transaction ID.","Jest (with Supertest), Mock Server (e.g., WireMock), Database client","6","12","4","Payments Service, Order Service (data), Notification Service (alerts)","Integration environment with a mock payment gateway.","Order status is correctly updated and alert is triggered 100% of the time on gateway failure.","High - Could lead to unhandled financial exceptions and customer complaints.","Every release","Medium","Reset order state in the database.","N/A","Response time < 500ms.","N/A"
