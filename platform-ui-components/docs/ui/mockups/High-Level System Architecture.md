# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Clients (Customer, Rider, Vendor, Admin)
- API Gateway
- Identity Service
- Vendor Service
- Order Service
- Rider Service
- Payment Service
- Notification Service
- Message Bus (SNS/SQS)
- Data Stores (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- External Services (Razorpay, Mapbox, FCM, SNS)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Synchronous user requests via API Gateway
- Asynchronous inter-service communication via Message Bus
- Integration with third-party APIs

## 3.3 Decision Points

- N/A for this high-level architectural diagram.

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Shows the standard flow of user requests and subsequent event propagation through the microservices ecosystem.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Not explicitly shown, as this is a high-level architecture diagram. Resilience patterns are implied by the asynchronous, decoupled architecture.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- N/A for this level of architectural detail.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram if new microservices are added, a major communication pattern is changed (e.g., sync to async), or a critical third-party dependency is replaced.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed this diagram in the main architecture documentation page in Confluence or the project's README.md.

# 7.0 Validation Checklist

- ✅ All critical system components from requirements are documented
- ✅ Asynchronous and synchronous communication paths are clearly distinguished
- ✅ No explicit decision points, which is appropriate for this high-level view
- ✅ Mermaid syntax validated and renders correctly
- ✅ Diagram serves intended audience needs (developers, architects)
- ✅ Visual hierarchy supports easy comprehension
- ✅ Styling is implicit and enhances clarity
- ✅ Accessible due to clear text labels and structural information
