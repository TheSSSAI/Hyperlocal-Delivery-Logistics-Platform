"RISK-001","Technical","A synchronous API call from the Vendor Service to the Order Service for product deletion (WI-016) creates tight coupling. If the Order Service is slow or unavailable, it could cause cascading failures by exhausting resources in the Vendor Service, impacting unrelated features.","3","4","12","Medium","VND-011 (Vendor Deletes a Product), WI-016 (Implement Product CRUD Endpoints).","Architectural choice of a synchronous, blocking dependency between microservices for a non-time-critical operation.","Refactor the deletion process to be asynchronous. The DELETE API should mark the product as 'DELETION_PENDING' and publish a 'ProductDeletionRequested' event. A background worker can then handle the cross-service check and final soft-deletion.","Implement an aggressive timeout (e.g., <500ms) and a circuit breaker pattern on the synchronous call. If the call fails or times out, the API should respond with an error and trigger a high-priority alert, preventing resource exhaustion.","Prometheus alert fires when the P99 latency of the internal API call to the Order Service exceeds 500ms or the error rate is >5% over a 5-minute window.","Backend Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The asynchronous bulk CSV import process (EPIC-004) is a distributed transaction that can lead to data corruption or inconsistency if a partial failure occurs (e.g., worker crashes after importing some rows but before completing the job).","3","5","15","High","VND-013, VND-014, WI-019 (Develop Background Worker for CSV Processing).","Inherent complexity of maintaining data integrity across an asynchronous workflow involving file parsing, validation, and batch database writes.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern. The worker processes the CSV and writes all product changes and a final 'job_complete' event to its local database within a single transaction. A separate relayer process then reliably forwards these events.","Develop a rollback script that can soft-delete all products associated with a specific `import_job_id`. Maintain immutable copies of all uploaded CSVs in a separate S3 bucket for manual reprocessing if necessary.","A high number of messages in the SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the import worker. An alert fires if a bulk import job's status remains 'PROCESSING' for longer than the defined threshold (e.g., 15 minutes).","Data Engineering Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","Inability to effectively debug failures in asynchronous background jobs (bulk import/export) due to insufficient observability, leading to prolonged resolution times and potential data loss. Standard API monitoring does not cover these workflows.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-004 (Bulk Data Operations), WI-008 (Integrate OpenTelemetry), WI-019, WI-025.","Observability for asynchronous processes is often an afterthought and is more complex to implement than for synchronous API requests.","Mandate the use of the OpenTelemetry SDK in the bootstrap process of all background workers. Ensure the `correlationId` from the initial API request is propagated through SQS message attributes and attached to all logs and traces within the worker.","Implement detailed, structured 'heartbeat' logging within long-running loops in the workers to provide a manual trace of progress if distributed tracing fails. Log every row number being processed.","A CI/CD quality gate that runs a 'tracer bullet' test: it triggers a simple async job and fails the build if a complete, end-to-end trace is not found in the observability platform (e.g., Jaeger/X-Ray) within 1 minute.","DevOps/SRE Lead","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","The project's broad technology stack (EKS, Terraform, OpenTelemetry, PostGIS, NestJS) may contain areas where the team has a significant skill gap, leading to suboptimal implementation, security vulnerabilities, or timeline delays due to a steep learning curve.","3","5","15","High","All Epics, particularly EPIC-001 (Infrastructure) and EPIC-004 (Asynchronous Processing).","Adoption of multiple complex, modern technologies without a formal assessment of the team's collective expertise in each.","Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment for the team. Schedule dedicated time for workshops and pair programming on critical, low-expertise areas. Mandate strict adherence to documented best practices and use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for complex designs.","Secure a budget for an expert consultant or use AWS Enterprise Support for critical design reviews, especially for the EKS/networking and PostGIS schemas. Allocate a 'risk buffer' of 20% to timelines for tasks involving low-expertise technologies.","An increase in the number of pull requests rejected for architectural reasons. A high number of questions or recurring issues related to a specific technology in team communication channels.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Performance of the catalog export query (WI-025) for a high-volume vendor (e.g., 50,000+ products) could cause extreme load on the primary PostgreSQL database, leading to platform-wide latency issues or a full outage.","3","4","12","Medium","VND-015 (Vendor Bulk Exports), WI-025 (Implement API and Worker for Catalog Export).","A long-running, heavy read operation being performed against the primary transactional database instead of a read replica or a different data store.","Mandate that the background export worker reads data from a dedicated read-replica of the PostgreSQL database, not the primary instance. Enforce the use of database cursors and streaming to process the result set in small chunks, never loading the entire catalog into memory.","Implement strict resource limits and a hard timeout on the export worker. If a job exceeds the timeout (e.g., 10 minutes), it is automatically terminated, and the vendor is notified of the failure. This protects the database at the cost of the feature failing.","Prometheus alert on high database CPU utilization or a high number of long-running queries detected by `pg_stat_activity` that correlate with the execution of an export job.","Backend Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","An outage or high latency from the external Mapbox API (WI-009) could block vendors from updating their address, which is a critical step that requires geocoding and validation against operational zones, potentially preventing them from going online.","3","3","9","Medium","VND-005 (Vendor Manages Store Profile), WI-009 (Implement Vendor Profile CRUD Endpoints).","Hard dependency on a third-party service for a core business validation rule in a user-facing workflow.","Implement a circuit breaker pattern on the Mapbox API client. Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors. Cache successful geocoding results in Redis with a TTL of 24 hours to reduce API calls for frequently updated addresses.","If the Mapbox API is down, the profile update API should allow the vendor to save other details but return a specific warning that the address could not be verified and might not be active until verification is complete. This avoids blocking the user completely.","Prometheus alerts on a high error rate (>5%) or P99 latency (>2s) for outgoing calls to the Mapbox API.","Backend Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","A delay in propagating a vendor's status change (e.g., 'Offline' in WI-011) across the distributed system could lead to customers placing orders at stores that have just closed, resulting in automatic cancellations and a negative user experience.","4","3","12","Medium","VND-007 (Vendor Toggles Store Availability), WI-011.","Reliance on eventual consistency for a time-sensitive business state across multiple microservices (Vendor, Search, Order).","Ensure the final, authoritative check of a vendor's availability happens within the Order Management service's 'create order' transaction. This service should query a low-latency data source (e.g., Redis, read-replica) that is updated by the `VendorStatusChanged` event.","If an order is created for a store that just went offline, the Order Management service should detect the mismatch and immediately move the order to a 'Cancelled' state with a specific reason code, triggering a full refund and an apology notification to the customer.","A custom metric that tracks the number of orders cancelled due to 'Vendor recently offline'. An alert fires if this rate exceeds a defined threshold.","Platform Architect","2024-07-10","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Security","Incomplete or inconsistent RBAC validation across different microservices could allow a user of one role (e.g., Vendor) to access or modify data belonging to another user or a higher-privileged role (e.g., Admin), leading to a data breach.","2","5","10","Medium","All tasks with API endpoints, especially WI-012, WI-024, and admin-facing features.","Decentralized implementation of authorization logic without a shared, mandatory framework, leading to potential gaps.","Develop a shared authorization library/package that is a mandatory dependency for all microservices. Implement RBAC checks within a global middleware/guard in the NestJS framework to ensure it is applied to all endpoints by default.","Implement a comprehensive and immutable audit trail for all data modification and sensitive read operations. In the event of a breach, these logs will be critical for forensic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the incident.","Automated penetration testing tools in the CI/CD pipeline that specifically check for authorization bypass vulnerabilities (e.g., Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR). Alerts on high rates of 403 Forbidden errors.","Security Lead","2024-06-25","In Progress"
