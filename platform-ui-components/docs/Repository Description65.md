# 3 Description

This new library contains a collection of shared, reusable UI components for both React and React Native frontends. It was created by extracting common visual elements (like buttons, input fields, modals, and layout primitives) from the four original frontend repositories. The primary responsibility of this repository is to enforce a consistent Design System across all client applications. It promotes code reuse, accelerates UI development, and ensures that branding and user experience are uniform. By centralizing these components, updates to the design system can be made in one place and rolled out across all applications by updating a single versioned dependency.

# 20 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2 Source Repository

REPO-FE-CUST, REPO-FE-RIDER, REPO-FE-VEND, REPO-FE-ADMIN

## 20.3 Decomposition Reasoning

Extracted to eliminate UI code duplication across the four separate frontend applications. This establishes a single source of truth for the design system, making it easier to maintain and evolve the platform's look and feel. It allows a dedicated frontend platform team to focus on building high-quality, accessible components independently of feature development teams.

## 20.4 Extracted Responsibilities

- Common UI components (Button, Input, Card, Modal)
- Theming variables (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Layout primitives (Grid, Stack, Box)

## 20.5 Reusability Scope

- Consumed by all four frontend applications.

## 20.6 Development Benefits

- Accelerates frontend development by providing a ready-made palette of components.
- Ensures visual and interactive consistency across the entire platform.

# 25.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1 Must Implement

- Pure, presentational UI components.
- Theming and styling logic.

## 25.2 Must Not Implement

- Any application-specific business logic or state management.
- API data fetching logic.

## 25.3 Extension Points

- Components should be composable and customizable via props.
