"Phase 1: Core APIs & Critical Paths","High","6","250","Jest (Supertest), Cypress, Detox/Appium","400","Very High - Reduces regression testing from 5 days to 4 hours per release.","10 hours/month","24","CI/CD integration for all test suites; Test data generation scripts.","98% automation pass rate in CI; 80% reduction in manual regression effort.","Mobile E2E test flakiness; Environment stability.","Implement robust selectors; Use dedicated, isolated test environments.","Accelerate release velocity; Improve defect detection early in the cycle."
"Phase 2: Performance & Security Baselines","High","4","50","k6, OWASP ZAP, Snyk/Trivy","160","High - Prevents critical performance and security incidents in production.","5 hours/month","16","Dedicated performance environment; Integration of security scanners in CI/CD.","All performance NFRs are met; Zero critical/high vulnerabilities in build.","Complexity of performance script creation; False positives from security scanners.","Use performance test recording tools; Establish a vulnerability triage process.","Ensure platform scalability, reliability, and security compliance."
"Phase 3: Expanded UI & Feature Coverage","Medium","8","400","Cypress, Detox/Appium","600","Medium - Reduces testing effort for non-critical features and edge cases.","20 hours/month","","Parallel execution setup for E2E tests.","Increase E2E test coverage to 85%; Further reduction in manual testing time.","High maintenance cost for UI tests.","Focus on reusable test components; Use visual regression testing for stable UIs.","Improve overall product quality and reduce regressions in secondary features."
