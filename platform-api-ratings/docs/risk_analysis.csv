"RISK-001","Technical","The distributed transaction management using the Saga pattern for checkout (WI-028) and user registration is highly complex. A bug in the implementation or compensating transactions could lead to data inconsistencies between services (e.g., payment captured but order not created), causing financial discrepancies and a poor user experience.","4","5","20","High","WI-028 (Checkout Orchestration Saga), WI-011 (User Creation), WI-020 (Vendor Registration), all financial transactions.","Inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across distributed microservices without native two-phase commit transactions.","1. Mandate a formal technical design review for the Saga implementation with senior engineers. 2. Develop a comprehensive integration test suite that covers all failure scenarios and validates the execution of compensating transactions. 3. Implement a 'choreography' based saga using SQS/SNS for maximum service decoupling.","Develop and deploy a reconciliation microservice that periodically scans for data inconsistencies between services (e.g., payments without orders) and flags them for manual or automated correction.","Prometheus alert fires when the count of 'failed_saga_compensations' metric exceeds a threshold. A high number of alerts from the reconciliation service.","Backend Lead","2024-07-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","A partial or full outage of the primary payment gateway (Razorpay) would immediately block all new online orders and automated payouts. This represents a single point of failure for the platform's entire revenue stream, as detailed in REQ-1-090 and WI-037.","3","5","15","High","WI-037 (Razorpay Integration), WI-040 (Payouts), CUS-025 (Customer Completes Online Payment), entire checkout flow.","Heavy dependency on a single third-party provider for a critical business function (payments and payouts).","1. Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern for all Razorpay API calls to prevent cascading failures. 2. On the frontend, if the circuit is open, automatically disable online payment options and display a user-friendly message, encouraging 'Cash on Delivery' where applicable.","Establish a documented runbook for the on-call team to manually trigger the payment reconciliation job (WI-038) once the Razorpay service is restored, to process any orders stuck in a pending state.","A Prometheus alert fires when the HTTP 5xx error rate for Razorpay API calls exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window. The circuit breaker enters the 'open' state.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The rider allocation algorithm (WI-032) relies on complex, high-frequency geospatial queries (PostGIS). An inefficient query or lack of proper database indexing could create a severe performance bottleneck as order volume increases, failing to meet the P95 allocation time of <30s (REQ-1-093) and delaying all deliveries.","3","5","15","High","WI-032 (Rider Allocation Algorithm), EPIC-005 (Rider Logistics Service), entire delivery fulfillment process.","The computational complexity of real-time geospatial matching at scale.","1. Ensure the PostgreSQL database has PostGIS enabled and a spatial index (GIST) is created on the riders' location column. 2. Conduct rigorous load testing of the allocation service, simulating peak order volume to identify query performance issues. 3. Implement caching for rider location data in Redis GEO for faster lookups.","If the primary algorithm fails or times out, implement a simpler fallback strategy (e.g., a wider, less precise geographic search) that can be triggered to ensure an order is not indefinitely stuck.","A Prometheus alert fires if the P95 latency for the rider allocation job exceeds 20 seconds. An increase in the 'allocation_failed' event count.","Backend Lead (Logistics)","2024-09-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","The project relies on a stack of specialized, high-complexity technologies (EKS, Terraform, PostGIS, Saga Pattern). A lack of deep expertise or the departure of a key team member could lead to significant implementation delays, architectural flaws, and security vulnerabilities.","3","4","12","Medium","All Epics, particularly EPIC-001 (Infrastructure) and EPIC-004 (Ordering).","High technological complexity combined with a potential key-person dependency and a competitive talent market.","1. Conduct a team skills matrix assessment to identify gaps. 2. Implement mandatory peer review and pair programming for all critical infrastructure and backend logic. 3. Thoroughly document all architectural decisions and operational procedures in a centralized knowledge base (Confluence/Notion).","Pre-approve a budget for engaging external, on-demand expert consultants for critical design reviews or to assist with specific complex implementations if the project timeline is at risk.","A key work item (e.g., WI-002 EKS Provisioning) is delayed by more than one sprint. High number of pull request revisions on critical components.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-30","In Progress"
"RISK-005","Operational","A failure in the central message bus (AWS SQS/SNS) could halt all asynchronous communication between microservices. This would prevent new order notifications to vendors, rider allocation, and other critical background processes, leading to a complete system standstill even if individual services are operational.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-017, WI-028, WI-032, all event-driven workflows.","Centralized dependency on the message bus for inter-service communication in a decoupled architecture.","1. Implement Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for all critical SQS queues. 2. Configure robust monitoring and alerting on the number of messages in DLQs and high queue latency. 3. Ensure all event consumers are idempotent to allow for safe reprocessing of messages from a DLQ.","Develop an operational runbook detailing the procedure for inspecting messages in a DLQ, identifying the root cause of the processing failure, and re-driving the messages after the issue is resolved.","Prometheus alert fires when the `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` in any critical DLQ is greater than zero.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Timeline","The project plan may underestimate the time and effort required for integrating the numerous microservices and external APIs. This can lead to a prolonged and difficult integration phase, delaying testing and the overall project timeline, as teams might assume their individual services work correctly in isolation.","4","4","16","High","All Epics, especially EPIC-004, EPIC-005, EPIC-006.","The inherent complexity of a distributed system where the true challenges often only appear during end-to-end integration.","1. Schedule dedicated 'integration sprints' or 'hardening sprints' before major releases. 2. Implement contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline to detect breaking changes in API contracts between services early. 3. Prioritize building and testing full end-to-end user flows (e.g., one complete order) early in the project, rather than completing entire services in silos.","Be prepared to de-scope non-critical features from the initial release to protect the launch date if integration efforts take longer than planned. Identify features for de-scoping in advance.","The number of integration-related bugs reported during E2E testing is higher than projected. Key E2E tests are consistently failing across multiple sprints.","Project Manager","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Security","Misconfiguration of AWS security groups, network ACLs, or IAM roles within the Terraform code could expose sensitive infrastructure, such as the RDS database or Redis cluster, to the public internet or allow unauthorized access between services. This could lead to a critical data breach.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-001, WI-002, WI-003, WI-004, the entire infrastructure provisioning process.","Complexity of managing cloud security settings via Infrastructure as Code, where a small error can have a large impact.","1. Mandate peer review for all Terraform pull requests, with a specific focus on security-related resources (IAM, Security Groups). 2. Integrate an automated IaC security scanner (e.g., Checkov, tfsec) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect common misconfigurations before deployment. 3. Follow the principle of least privilege for all IAM roles.","Develop an incident response plan for a suspected cloud security breach. Use AWS Config to continuously monitor for and alert on non-compliant resource configurations.","Automated IaC scanner fails a build in the CI pipeline. An alert from AWS GuardDuty or AWS Config indicates a security group misconfiguration.","Security Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","The OTP-based authentication flow is critically dependent on the timely delivery of SMS messages via AWS SNS. Delays or failures in the SMS gateway can prevent users from registering or logging in, effectively locking them out of the platform and causing significant user frustration.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-010, WI-011, WI-012, CUS-001, CUS-003, RDR-001, RDR-004, VND-001, VND-004.","Dependency on a third-party communication channel with no guaranteed delivery SLA.","1. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting on the SMS delivery success rate and P95 delivery latency. 2. Design the 'Resend OTP' functionality with a clear cooldown timer to manage user expectations. 3. Research and pre-vet a secondary SMS provider as a potential fallback.","If a major SNS outage occurs, the on-call team has a runbook to manually switch to a pre-configured secondary SMS provider by updating the configuration in AWS Secrets Manager.","A Prometheus alert fires if the SMS delivery success rate drops below 98% or if P95 delivery latency exceeds 30 seconds.","Backend Lead (Identity)","2024-07-20","Not Started"
