# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary Responsibility: Be the system of record for all user-generated ratings and reviews for both vendors and riders.
- Secondary Responsibility: Calculate and serve aggregated data, such as average ratings and rating counts, to other services and clients.
- Explicitly Out of Scope: Real-time chat, support tickets, or any other form of communication. This service focuses solely on post-transaction feedback.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (TypeScript) for the application framework, leveraging its modular architecture, dependency injection, and provider model.
- PostgreSQL as the relational database for persisting structured rating data, likely managed via an ORM like TypeORM or Prisma.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a distinct microservice within the AWS ecosystem, as mandated by REQ-1-007 and REQ-1-104.
- Optimized for a mixed workload: write-heavy during rating submissions and read-heavy for profile views and data aggregation, justifying its separation from the real-time chat service.
- Must adhere to event-driven patterns for inter-service communication where appropriate, specifically for reacting to order completion events (REQ-1-105).

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Upstream Asynchronous Dependency: REPO-BE-ORDER

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Upstream Asynchronous Dependency

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

REPO-BE-ORDER

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Event-driven consumption via an SNS topic and SQS queue.

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

The service is triggered by an 'OrderDeliveredEvent' published by the Order service. This decouples the services and provides a resilient, scalable mechanism to know when an order becomes eligible for rating, directly fulfilling the business logic that ratings are for completed orders only.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Upstream Synchronous Dependency: REPO-BE-ORDER

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

Upstream Synchronous Dependency

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

REPO-BE-ORDER

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

RESTful API Call (HTTPS/JSON).

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

When a rating is submitted, this service may need to make a synchronous call to the Order service to fetch authoritative order details (e.g., to verify the submitter is the actual customer) before persisting the rating, ensuring data integrity.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Downstream Synchronous Dependency (Consumers): platform-api-vendor, platform-api-rider, platform-api-customer-gateway

##### 2.1.4.3.1 Dependency Type

Downstream Synchronous Dependency (Consumers)

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

platform-api-vendor, platform-api-rider, platform-api-customer-gateway

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

RESTful API Provider (HTTPS/JSON).

##### 2.1.4.3.4 Reasoning

This service exposes APIs to provide individual reviews and calculated average ratings. Other services (like Vendor, Rider) and client gateways will consume this data to display on profiles, making this repository the source of truth for reputation data.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-api-ratings' service is a well-defined microservice that perfectly embodies the principles of Single Responsibility and Domain-Driven Design. Its primary interaction is reactive, triggered by the completion of an order, which is a robust architectural choice. Its role as the central source of truth for reputation data makes its read-APIs critical for the user experience of the entire platform.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

The rating system shall allow customers to provide separate feedback for the vendor and the rider.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The database schema must include a 'revieweeType' field (e.g., ENUM 'VENDOR', 'RIDER') to distinguish the target of the rating.
- The rating submission API will likely accept an array of rating objects or be called twice per order—once for the vendor and once for the rider—to create two distinct rating records.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- RatingsController
- RatingsService
- RatingReview Entity

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly shapes the core data model. The distinction between a vendor and rider rating is fundamental, necessitating a polymorphic association within the rating entity to a 'reviewee'.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-064

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

The system shall automatically calculate and display the average star rating for each vendor...and...for each rider...

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose API endpoints to retrieve the average rating for a given vendor or rider ID.
- The database query to calculate the average ('AVG(rating)') must be highly optimized with an index on the 'revieweeId' column to handle the high read load from profile views.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- RatingsController
- RatingsService

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement defines the primary read-path and aggregation function of the service. The performance of this calculation is critical, as it will be called frequently. The implementation must decide whether to calculate this on-the-fly or use a more complex but performant approach like materialized views or caching if the data volume grows significantly.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

P95 server-side latency for critical APIs must be under 200ms (REQ-1-093).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Database indexes on foreign keys ('orderId', 'reviewerId') and especially on queryable fields ('revieweeId') are mandatory. The average rating calculation must be benchmarked to ensure it meets this latency requirement.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Avoid complex joins in read queries.
- Consider caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed average ratings.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The high frequency of profile views across the platform means the APIs serving rating data will be hot paths. Performance is non-negotiable and must be designed in from the start.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be enforced. Authorization checks must be performed within each microservice (REQ-1-096, REQ-1-098).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

NestJS Guards must be implemented for API endpoints. For rating submission, a custom guard will be required to verify that the authenticated user is the customer who placed the order being rated.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- The service must have a mechanism to validate order ownership, likely via an API call to the Order Service.
- User-generated review text must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Authorization is critical to maintain data integrity and prevent fraudulent reviews. The service cannot trust the client; it must independently verify that the action is permissible for the authenticated user.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The requirements for this service are focused and clear. They revolve around two core use cases: submitting feedback and consuming aggregated feedback. The functional requirements define the 'what', while the non-functional requirements, particularly performance and security, strongly influence the 'how', dictating a need for optimized database queries and robust authorization logic.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Microservice

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The repository is a single, independently deployable microservice focused exclusively on managing ratings and reviews, adhering to the principles of Single Responsibility and Domain-Driven Design (REQ-1-104).

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- RatingsModule
- RatingsController
- RatingsService

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A standard NestJS application structure will be used, with the core logic encapsulated in a feature module. It will be containerized with Docker and deployed to Amazon EKS (REQ-1-018).

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The separation of ratings from other communication types allows for independent scaling and development, which is a primary benefit of the microservices architecture mandated by the project.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Consumer

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as a consumer of the 'OrderDeliveredEvent'. It listens for this event to know when an order becomes eligible for a rating, demonstrating an asynchronous, choreographed interaction pattern (REQ-1-105).

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- SqsConsumerService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A NestJS provider will be implemented using a library like 'nestjs-sqs' to listen to a dedicated SQS queue. The handler method will process the event, potentially creating a 'rateable order' entry to simplify the submission logic.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern ensures loose coupling and high resilience. If the Ratings service is down, order completion events will queue up in SQS and be processed once the service recovers, preventing data loss.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

Asynchronous Event Ingestion

#### 4.2.1.2.0 Target Components

#### 4.2.1.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous (Pub/Sub) via AWS SNS/SQS.

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Must subscribe to the 'order-events' SNS topic.
- Must be able to parse the 'OrderDeliveredEvent' message contract.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary trigger for the service's workflow, allowing it to react to business events happening elsewhere in the system in a decoupled manner.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Synchronous API Provider

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- platform-api-vendor
- platform-api-rider
- Client Applications

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous (Request/Response) via REST/HTTPS.

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Expose versioned, JSON-based RESTful APIs.
- Provide endpoints for submitting new ratings and retrieving existing ratings and averages.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary mechanism for other parts of the system to consume the data owned by the Ratings service.

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

- {'sequence_name': 'Customer Submits Rating (Sequence ID: 220)', 'repository_role': 'Primary Processor. This service is the main recipient and handler of the rating submission request.', 'required_interfaces': ['IRatingsService'], 'method_specifications': [{'method_name': 'submitRating', 'interaction_context': "Called by the RatingsController upon receiving a 'POST /api/v1/ratings' request.", 'parameter_analysis': "Receives a 'CreateRatingDto' containing the order ID, target entity (vendor/rider), rating, and review text, as well as the authenticated user's context.", 'return_type_analysis': 'Returns the newly created RatingReview entity or throws a business exception (e.g., Forbidden, Conflict).', 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method orchestrates the entire submission workflow: authorizing the user, validating that the order is eligible and has not been rated before, persisting the new rating, and triggering any post-save logic like updating aggregates.'}], 'analysis_reasoning': 'The sequence diagram clearly shows this service as the central authority for rating submissions. Its implementation must be transactional and robust to ensure data integrity.'}

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

REST/HTTPS

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

Standard NestJS controllers will be used to define endpoints. DTOs with 'class-validator' will enforce request body contracts. Global 'ValidationPipe' and 'AllExceptionsFilter' will be configured in 'main.ts' for consistency.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the standard, stateless communication protocol for synchronous API interactions within the platform's microservice architecture.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

SNS/SQS

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

An SQS consumer will be implemented within a NestJS service. It will poll a queue subscribed to the 'order-events' SNS topic. The handler will be decorated to process messages matching the 'OrderDeliveredEvent' schema.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This asynchronous protocol is used for inter-service event notification, providing resilience and decoupling as required by the architecture.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided context artifacts. The repository description and architecture map defined the scope and key integrations. The requirements map ('REQ-1-063', 'REQ-1-064') dictated the core functional logic. The database diagrams provided the entity structure ('RatingReview'), and the sequence diagrams ('id: 220') detailed the primary interaction flow. All conclusions are directly traceable to these inputs.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified the repository as a CRUD and aggregation service.
- Mapped 'REQ-1-063' to a data model with a polymorphic 'reviewee' target.
- Mapped 'REQ-1-064' to an aggregation function and a read-API endpoint.
- Confirmed the primary trigger is an asynchronous 'OrderDeliveredEvent' from the Order service.
- Specified implementation details using NestJS patterns (Guards, Pipes, Services, Modules) to satisfy NFRs.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that while the service listens for an 'OrderDeliveredEvent', it may still need to perform a synchronous API call to the Order service for authorization and to get the latest order details upon submission. This is a common pattern for robust validation.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- The database entity 'RatingReview' from the DB diagram aligns perfectly with the needs of requirements 'REQ-1-063' and 'REQ-1-064'.
- The asynchronous integration pattern described in the architecture map is consistent with the event-driven architecture pattern ('REQ-1-105').
- The sequence diagram for submitting a rating ('id: 220') validates the service's role as the primary processor for this use case.
