"RISK-001","Technical","The product deletion feature (WI-008) requires a synchronous API call to the Order Management service. If the Order service is slow or unavailable, it will directly degrade the performance and availability of the Vendor & Catalog service's product management endpoints, creating a cascading failure across the system.","4","4","16","High","WI-008: Implement API Endpoints for Product Management (CRUD), specifically the DELETE operation. Vendor catalog management.","Architectural choice of a synchronous, blocking inter-service dependency in a microservices environment, which is a known anti-pattern for resilience.","Redesign the deletion logic to be asynchronous. Mark the product as 'PENDING_DELETION' and publish a 'ProductDeletionRequested' event. A consumer in the Order service validates and publishes a confirmation event, which a worker then uses to finalize the soft-delete.","Implement an aggressive circuit breaker with a short timeout (e.g., 1500ms) on the synchronous call. If the circuit is open or the call times out, the API should fail gracefully and return a '503 Service Unavailable' error, instructing the user to try again later.","P95 latency for the `DELETE /products/{id}` endpoint exceeds 500ms. The error rate for this endpoint spikes above 5% over a 5-minute window.","Backend Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Features like the store availability toggle (WI-005) rely on publishing an event to SNS. If the database update succeeds but event publishing fails, the system enters an inconsistent state (e.g., vendor is 'offline' in DB but 'online' in search), leading to failed orders and customer frustration.","3","5","15","High","WI-005: Store Availability Toggle, and any other feature relying on event publishing for state propagation across microservices.","Lack of atomicity between a local database transaction and an external message publishing action in a distributed system.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern. The database update and the event payload are written to an 'outbox' table in the same local transaction. A separate, reliable worker process polls this table and guarantees event publication to SNS.","Implement a reconciliation job that runs every 15 minutes to compare vendor statuses between the Vendor service and the Search service's index, correcting any discrepancies found. This acts as a safety net for any missed events.","An alert fires when the number of unprocessed records in the 'outbox' table exceeds 100, or when the oldest unprocessed record is more than 2 minutes old.","Backend Lead","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The Vendor & Catalog service has critical dependencies on four other internal microservices (Order Management, Identity, Notification, Audit). Any delay in the development, deployment, or API stabilization of these services will directly block the Vendor service, causing significant timeline slippage.","4","4","16","High","WI-008, WI-014, WI-016, and most other work items with internal dependencies. This affects the entire project timeline.","Tight coupling and numerous dependencies in a parallel multi-team microservice development environment without a clear integration strategy.","Establish a Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (e.g., using Pact) strategy. The Vendor service team defines and publishes the exact API contracts they need. The other teams' CI/CD pipelines run these contract tests to prevent breaking changes. Develop against stable, deployed mock servers (e.g., Prism) based on OpenAPI specs.","Allocate a specific 'integration buffer' (e.g., 1-2 weeks) in the project plan. Prioritize developing features with fewer cross-service dependencies first to maintain momentum while APIs are being stabilized.","A contract test fails in a dependent service's CI pipeline. A feature branch in the Vendor service remains blocked for more than 3 days waiting for a dependent API.","Project Manager","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The bulk CSV import feature (WS-003) is highly complex. A bug in the parsing, validation, or database update logic could lead to mass data corruption for a vendor's catalog. Partial success model (some rows succeed, some fail) increases risk of data inconsistency and makes rollbacks difficult.","4","4","16","High","WS-003: Bulk Catalog Operations (CSV), especially WI-010 and WI-011. This affects vendor onboarding and data integrity.","Inherent complexity of bulk data processing, file parsing, and performing thousands of database writes in a transactional and performant manner.","Enforce atomicity at the file level by wrapping the entire file's processing in a single, large database transaction. Implement a 'preview' step where the file is processed without committing, and the vendor must approve a summary of changes before the final commit is executed.","Ensure robust database point-in-time recovery is enabled and tested. Maintain an immutable log of all uploaded files and the specific changes they produced, allowing for a targeted manual or scripted rollback if a major issue is discovered post-facto.","Database CPU/IOPS metrics spike and sustain above 80% during an import job. A single import job runs for longer than the 10-minute threshold.","Backend Lead","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The automated job for suspending vendors with expired licenses (WI-016) is a critical operation. A bug in the logic (e.g., timezone error, date comparison flaw) could incorrectly suspend a large number of compliant vendors, causing immediate revenue loss and destroying vendor trust.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-016: Implement Logic for Automatic Vendor Suspension. This affects vendor relations and platform revenue.","The risk of deploying automated, destructive actions without sufficient safeguards and manual oversight, especially when complex logic like date/time is involved.","The job must be implemented with a mandatory 'dry-run' mode that only logs which vendors *would be* suspended. Require manual review and approval of this list by an Operations Manager before the job can be run in 'live' mode. Implement the job to suspend vendors in small, controlled batches with delays to limit blast radius.","Create and test a documented, one-click 'emergency rollback' script that can reactivate all vendors suspended by a specific job run ID. Prepare a communication template for the support team to use with any wrongfully suspended vendors.","An alert fires if the number of vendors suspended by a single job run exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., >0.5% of the total active vendor base).","Operations Manager","2024-09-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","The vendor profile update feature (WI-003) has a hard dependency on the external Mapbox Geocoding API. If this API is unavailable, slow, or returns inaccurate data, vendors will be unable to update their addresses, potentially blocking onboarding or causing incorrect delivery coordinates and failed deliveries.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-003: Integrate Mapbox Geocoding for Address Updates. Downstream impact on delivery success and logistics.","Dependency on a third-party service for a critical business function without a robust resiliency or fallback plan.","Implement a circuit breaker pattern (e.g., using `nestjs-resilience`) that temporarily disables the address update feature if the Mapbox API shows a high failure rate. Implement short-term caching (e.g., Redis with 1-hour TTL) for geocoding results to reduce API calls and mitigate brief outages.","In the case of a prolonged Mapbox outage, have a documented support process for an administrator to manually look up and update a vendor's coordinates in the database via the admin panel.","The error rate for API calls to Mapbox exceeds 10% over a 5-minute window. P95 latency for the Mapbox API exceeds 2 seconds.","Backend Developer","2024-08-20","Not Started"
