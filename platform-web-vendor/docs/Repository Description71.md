# 3 Description

This repository contains the React.js source code for the vendor-facing web dashboard. It is the primary interface for vendors to manage their entire presence on the platform, including their store profile, business hours, product catalog, and inventory levels. A key function is the real-time management of incoming orders, allowing vendors to accept or reject them. This dashboard is designed for desktop and tablet use, focusing on efficient data entry and management workflows, such as bulk product uploads. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new shared UI and API client libraries.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The repository's purpose as a standalone vendor dashboard is preserved. By abstracting common components and API logic into shared libraries, the vendor dashboard codebase becomes more focused on the complex business logic of catalog, inventory, and order management, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Shared UI components are now consumed from REPO-UI-COMPONENTS.
- API data fetching logic is now handled by REPO-API-CLIENT.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a top-level application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows the team to focus on building efficient and powerful data management tools for vendors.
- Faster and more consistent UI development.
