"TEST-E2E-001","Order Lifecycle","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end happy path of a customer placing a prepaid order, a vendor accepting it, a rider delivering it, and the customer rating the experience.","Critical - This is the core revenue-generating workflow of the platform.","High","Customer, Vendor, and Rider accounts exist and are active. Vendor is online with in-stock products. Rider is online and available.","1. Customer logs in, adds item to cart, checks out. 2. Customer completes payment via Razorpay sandbox. 3. Verify order appears on Vendor dashboard. 4. Vendor accepts order, sets prep time. 5. Vendor marks order 'Ready for Pickup'. 6. Verify Rider receives task offer. 7. Rider accepts task, navigates to vendor, marks 'Picked Up'. 8. Customer verifies live tracking is active. 9. Rider navigates to customer, completes POD, marks 'Delivered'. 10. Customer receives delivery notification and is prompted to rate.","Order successfully moves through all states ('Pending' -> 'Preparing' -> 'Ready' -> 'In Transit' -> 'Delivered'). All notifications are received. All user dashboards update correctly.","Active Customer/Vendor/Rider test accounts, Razorpay test credentials, products with stock > 0.","Cypress (Web Dashboards), Appium/Detox (Mobile Apps), Mock SMTP/SMS service.","16","40","24","All core microservices (Identity, Vendor, Order, Rider, Payments, Notifications) must be deployed and functional.","Staging environment with all services and external integrations (Razorpay Sandbox, Mapbox).","100% test pass rate. All state transitions are logged correctly in the order event log.","Critical - Failure indicates a complete breakdown of the core business process.","Every release, nightly build.","High - Requires orchestration across multiple user roles.","Reset state of all test users (cart, tasks, status).","Ensure no leakage of data between user roles during the flow.","E2E flow should complete within 5 minutes in an automated test.","N/A for backend orchestration, but UI steps must be accessible for automation tools."
"TEST-SEC-001","Authorization","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) prevention. A logged-in user (e.g., Customer A) cannot access or modify resources belonging to another user (e.g., Customer B's order history).","Critical - Data breach, privacy violation, compliance failure (DPDP Act).","Medium","Two distinct user accounts (User A, User B) exist. User B has resources (e.g., an order with ID 'order-B').","1. Authenticate as User A and obtain a valid JWT. 2. Make an API call to an endpoint to access User B's resource (e.g., GET /api/v1/orders/order-B). 3. Repeat for PATCH/DELETE endpoints.","The API must return a 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found status code. No data belonging to User B must be returned or modified.","Two distinct user accounts of each role (Customer, Vendor, Rider) with associated resources.","Postman, Jest/Supertest, or any HTTP client capable of scripting.","8","16","4","Identity & Access service, any service with resource ownership (Orders, Profiles, etc.).","Integration or Staging environment.","100% of unauthorized requests are rejected with the correct status code.","Critical - Leads to major security vulnerabilities and data breaches.","Every release.","Medium","None.","This is a core security test.","N/A","N/A"
"TEST-PERF-001","Product Discovery","Performance","System","High","true","High","Verify the P95 latency of the search API endpoint (`/api/v1/search`) under sustained load, as per REQ-FUN-004.","High - Slow search performance leads to poor user experience and high cart abandonment.","High","The search index (OpenSearch) is populated with a large, realistic dataset (>100k products).","1. Configure load testing tool (k6) to simulate 1000 virtual users. 2. Ramp up users over 2 minutes. 3. Each user performs a search query from a predefined list of popular terms for 10 minutes. 4. Monitor P95 latency, error rate, and throughput.","P95 latency remains under 500ms. Error rate is less than 0.1%. Throughput meets the target of 2000 requests per minute.","Large, indexed dataset in OpenSearch. A list of diverse search terms.","k6, Grafana, Prometheus.","12","24","8","Search service, OpenSearch cluster.","Dedicated, scalable Performance testing environment that mirrors production infrastructure.","P95 < 500ms; Error rate < 0.1%.","High - Indicates the system cannot scale to meet user demand.","Before every major release.","High","None.","Run tests against a non-production endpoint.","This test defines the performance expectation.","N/A"
"TEST-INT-001","Vendor Compliance","Functional","Integration","High","true","High","Verify the automated vendor suspension flow. The scheduled job correctly identifies an expired license and publishes a `VendorSuspended` event, which is consumed by the Order service to block new orders.","High - Failure to block non-compliant vendors poses a legal and reputational risk.","High","A vendor exists with a license expiry date set to yesterday. The scheduled job infrastructure is in place. Order and Vendor services are running.","1. Manually trigger the scheduled compliance job. 2. Verify the job logs indicate the vendor was identified. 3. Verify the vendor's status in the database is updated to 'suspended_license_expired'. 4. Verify a `VendorSuspended` event was published to the message bus. 5. Attempt to create a new order for the suspended vendor via the Order service API.","The order creation attempt fails with an error indicating the vendor is unavailable. The vendor's status is correctly updated.","A vendor test account with an expired license.","Jest/Supertest, AWS CLI (for triggering Lambda/job), Database client.","8","18","6","Vendor service, Order service, Message Bus (SQS/SNS), Scheduled Job infrastructure.","Integration environment.","100% pass rate.
