## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Provide the complete web-based user interface for the 'Vendor' user role.
- Manage all vendor-centric workflows: store profile, business hours, product catalog (CRUD and bulk operations), real-time order management, viewing ratings, financial statements, license compliance, and support tickets.
- Act as a client application within the microservices architecture, consuming backend services via a central API Gateway.
- Does not own or persist any data directly; it is a presentation and interaction layer.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- React.js v18.2+ with Vite for the core framework and build tooling.
- TypeScript for static typing and code quality.
- TanStack Query for server state management (data fetching, caching, and mutations).
- A WebSocket client library (e.g., socket.io-client) for real-time communication.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must conform to the overall Microservices architecture as a client application.
- All backend communication (HTTP and WebSocket) must be routed through the central API Gateway.
- Must achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds, mandating performance optimization techniques like code-splitting.
- User authentication must be handled via short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.

The chosen technology stack (React, TypeScript, TanStack Query) is well-suited to meet these demands.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Single Page Application (SPA)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The entire vendor dashboard is built as an SPA. The client-side application is loaded once, and subsequent navigation and data updates are handled dynamically using React Router and API calls, providing a fluid, app-like experience.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- React Router for client-side routing
- TanStack Query for managing server state
- Root App component

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A main App component will set up providers (TanStack Query, Router) and render the main layout (Header, Sidebar). Routes will be defined to render different page-level components, which in turn compose smaller UI components.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the standard architectural pattern for modern, data-driven web applications and is the natural choice for a React.js project.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Client-Side Caching / Server State Management

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

TanStack Query is used to manage all server state. It treats data fetched from the backend API as cached, server-owned state, automatically handling data fetching, caching, background updates, and mutations.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- QueryClientProvider
- Custom hooks wrapping 'useQuery' and 'useMutation'

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Data fetching logic will be encapsulated in custom hooks (e.g., 'useProducts', 'useUpdateOrder'). Components will consume these hooks to get data and loading/error states, decoupling them from the data fetching mechanism itself.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern drastically simplifies data management, improves performance by reducing redundant API calls, and provides a better user experience with features like stale-while-revalidate.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

This is the primary integration for all CRUD operations and data fetching, mandated by the microservices architecture.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Real-time Events

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- API Gateway (WebSocket Endpoint)

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

- JWT for connection authentication.
- A documented schema for all event names (e.g., 'new_order') and their JSON payloads.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Required for real-time features like new order notifications (VND-016) and chat (VND-024), providing a more efficient and responsive experience than HTTP polling.

Likely requires filename and file type to generate the URL.

###### 6.1.1.4.1.4 Return Type Analysis

Returns a pre-signed S3 URL for direct browser upload and a job ID for tracking.

###### 6.1.1.4.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

As per sequence diagram 208, this is the first step to securely upload a large file without routing it through the service.

##### 6.1.1.4.2.0 Method Name

###### 6.1.1.4.2.1 Method Name

notifyUploadComplete

###### 6.1.1.4.2.2 Interaction Context

After the browser successfully uploads the file to S3.

###### 6.1.1.4.2.3 Parameter Analysis

Takes the job ID received from 'getBulkUploadUrl'.

###### 6.1.1.4.2.4 Return Type Analysis

Returns an acknowledgment that the background processing has been queued.

###### 6.1.1.4.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This triggers the asynchronous backend job to process the CSV file.

##### 6.1.1.4.3.0 Method Name

###### 6.1.1.4.3.1 Method Name

socket.on('import_complete')

###### 6.1.1.4.3.2 Interaction Context

N/A (event handler).

###### 6.1.1.4.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This provides the real-time feedback to the user that their bulk import job has finished, as per sequence diagram 208.

#### 6.1.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The bulk upload sequence (ID: 208) demonstrates a complex, asynchronous workflow that the vendor dashboard must manage, involving direct cloud storage interaction and real-time notifications.

### 6.1.2.0.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0.0 Sequence Name

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

This analysis comprehensively utilizes all provided context items. REQ-* items define the functional and non-functional backbone. VND-* user stories provide the detailed feature specifications. The architecture documents define the technical constraints and patterns. Database schemas inform the client-side data models. Sequence diagrams clarify the dynamic interaction patterns the frontend must implement.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to base the data access layer entirely on TanStack Query is derived from the data-heavy nature of the dashboard and the strict performance NFRs (REQ-1-093).
- Decision to use an event-driven approach for real-time updates is based on architectural mandates (REQ-1-105) and functional requirements for live order notifications (VND-016).
- Decision to require a shared API client library is based on the need for consistency, maintainability, and alignment with the OpenAPI specification (REQ-1-101).

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that a shared UI component library and API client library will be provided as internal packages is validated by the repository definition.
- Assumption that the backend will provide a robust OpenAPI specification is validated by REQ-1-101.
- Assumption of a real-time communication channel is validated by REQ-1-092 (WSS) and multiple user stories requiring real-time updates.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- User story VND-016 (Real-time orders) cross-references with REQ-1-092 (WSS protocol) and the Architecture's event-driven patterns.
- User story VND-013 (Bulk Import) cross-references with sequence diagram 208, confirming the asynchronous workflow involving S3 and WebSocket notifications.
- Requirement REQ-1-096 (JWTs) cross-references with all user stories requiring authentication (e.g., VND-004) and dictates the implementation of the API client.
