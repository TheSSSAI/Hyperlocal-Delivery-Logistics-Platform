"RISK-R001","Key Person Dependency","RISK-001/RISK-002: Senior Developer (backend-dev-1) is a single point of failure for all complex architectural and distributed systems tasks (e.g., Transactional Outbox). Any unavailability will halt critical path progress.","Medium","Critical","[""VND-007-T2"",""VND-011-T1"",""VND-013-T1"",""VND-029-T3""]","3","Mandate pair programming between senior and mid-level developers on all high-complexity tasks. Enforce rigorous documentation for all architectural designs.","Identify a pre-vetted senior backend contractor for emergency backfill. Allocate tech lead's time as a backup.","Senior developer's allocated sprint hours exceed 90% of their capacity.","20000","Ongoing"
"RISK-R002","External Dependency","RISK-003: High dependency on the Order Management service team for the vendor suspension feature (VND-029-T3).
