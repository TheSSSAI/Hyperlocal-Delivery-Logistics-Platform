# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Client App
- Identity & Access Service
- Redis Cache

## 3.2 Key Processes

- OTP validation

- User attempts to log in while the account is locked.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The exact attempt that triggers the account lockout.
- An attempt to log in immediately after the lockout period expires.
