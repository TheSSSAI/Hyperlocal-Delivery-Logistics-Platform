"Phase 1: Core Transaction & Auth Flows","High","6","80","Cypress, Appium, Jest, Postman","320","Very High - Reduces regression time for critical paths by 90%.","10 hours/month","24","CI/CD pipeline setup for all test levels; Test environment stabilization.","98% automation pass rate in CI; Full regression suite runs in < 30 minutes.","Mobile automation (Appium/Detox) setup can be complex and time-consuming.","Allocate a dedicated sprint for setting up mobile automation framework; Use a device farm like AWS Device Farm for parallel execution.","Enables confident and frequent releases of core revenue-generating features."
"Phase 2: Admin & Vendor Workflows","Medium","4","60","Cypress, Jest","200","Medium - Automates repetitive but less critical workflows, freeing up manual QA effort.","5 hours/month","","N/A (Uses existing setup)","80% of admin and vendor management scenarios are automated.","Admin UI may have frequent changes, increasing maintenance.","Build a resilient and modular test framework using Page Object Model.","Improves quality of operational tools and reduces manual testing burden."
"Phase 3: Performance & Security Automation","High","4","20","k6, OWASP ZAP, Snyk","160","High - Proactively identifies performance regressions and security vulnerabilities before production.","8 hours/month","16","Dedicated performance environment; Integration of security scanners into CI/CD.","Automated performance tests run nightly; Security scans run on every build.","False positives from security scanners; Difficulty in simulating realistic load.","Fine-tune security scanner rules; Use production traffic analysis to build load profiles.","Reduces risk of production outages and security breaches."
