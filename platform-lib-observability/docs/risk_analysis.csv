"RISK-004","Performance","Poorly optimized geospatial queries (PostGIS) for rider allocation and vendor discovery could lead to high API latency (>200ms NFR), causing a poor user experience, slow rider assignment (<30s NFR), and system bottlenecks under the target load of 100 orders/min.","3","4","12","Medium","CUS-010 (Customer Views Nearby Vendors), REQ-1-078 (Rider Allocation Algorithm), WI-012 (Profile and Address Management).","The need for complex, real-time spatial queries against a growing dataset of vendors and riders, which requires specialized database knowledge to optimize.","Ensure all geospatial columns have GIST indexes. Conduct mandatory query plan analysis (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) for all spatial queries. Implement aggressive performance testing specifically targeting the vendor discovery and rider allocation endpoints under simulated peak load.","Develop a simpler, fallback allocation logic that uses coarse-grained zones instead of fine-grained radius queries, which can be enabled via a feature flag if the primary logic suffers performance degradation.","Prometheus alert on P95 latency for `/api/v1/vendors/nearby` or the internal rider allocation service endpoint exceeding 200ms for more than 5 minutes.","Backend Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Inadequate testing of race conditions in inventory management could lead to overselling items (multiple customers buying the last item simultaneously), resulting in forced order cancellations, negative customer experiences, and vendor frustration.","4","3","12","Medium","CUS-024 (Customer Notified of Stock Change), WI-018 (Cart Management APIs), WI-019 (Order Creation Saga).","High-concurrency access to shared resources (product stock counts) during the checkout process without proper locking or transactional controls.","Implement pessimistic locking (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) on the product inventory row within the database transaction during the final availability check (REQ-1-055). Write dedicated integration tests that simulate concurrent purchase attempts for the last item in stock.","The vendor cancellation workflow (VND-022) serves as the primary contingency. An operational runbook should be created for the support team to handle customer complaints arising from overselling, including offering goodwill credits.","An increase in the rate of vendor-initiated cancellations with the reason 'Item out of stock', monitored via a Grafana dashboard.","QA Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Security","A vulnerability in the OTP-based authentication flow or JWT management could allow for account takeover, granting unauthorized access to user PII, order history, and financial payout details, leading to severe reputational damage and legal liability.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-011 (Develop OTP-based Endpoints), CUS-003 (Customer Login), REQ-1-096 (Use AWS Cognito).","Complexity of implementing a custom authentication flow, secure token handling (especially refresh tokens), and session invalidation across a distributed system (REQ-1-040, REQ-1-041).","Leverage AWS Cognito's built-in security features wherever possible. Enforce server-side rate limiting and account lockout (REQ-1-041). Implement a JWT revocation list using Redis for immediate session invalidation upon logout or suspension. Conduct mandatory annual third-party penetration testing (REQ-1-098).","An incident response plan must include a 'master switch' to force-invalidate all active sessions and require all users to re-authenticate.
