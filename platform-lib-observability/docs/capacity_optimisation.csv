"Cross-training","Single point of failure on DevOps and advanced backend topics.","Dedicate 4 hours/sprint for Backend Lead to mentor mid-level backend developer on distributed systems. Dedicate 4 hours/sprint for backend developer to cross-train on Terraform and basic CI/CD maintenance.","Reduces key-person dependency by 30%. Increases bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical skills.","8","12 weeks","Mid-level developer can independently resolve medium-complexity distributed system bugs.","Avoids potential 2-4 week project delay if lead is unavailable, saving approx. $20,000-$40,000."
"Resource Augmentation","Frontend development is the primary bottleneck, with a -200 hour capacity deficit over the project timeline.","Hire one mid-level Frontend (React/React Native) contractor for the project duration (approx. 20 weeks).","Reduces project timeline from a high-risk 30 weeks to an achievable 20 weeks. Enables parallelization of frontend work.","52000","20 weeks","Frontend work is no longer on the critical path; project delivered 10 weeks earlier.","Earlier time-to-market and reduced internal resource cost outweighs contractor expense."
