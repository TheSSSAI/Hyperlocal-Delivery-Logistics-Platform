"RISK-R010","Skill Gap","Project requires advanced skills (Kubernetes, Terraform, Distributed Systems). A skill gap or loss of a key team member could significantly delay development and compromise quality.","Medium","High","[""All critical path tasks""]","8","Promote knowledge sharing through mandatory pair programming on complex tasks. Enforce comprehensive documentation. Cross-train team members on critical systems.","Maintain a pre-vetted list of contractors for rapid staff augmentation.","Any task blocked for more than one week due to a skill gap.","40000","4 weeks to onboard new resource"
"RISK-R004","Performance","Poorly optimized geospatial queries (PostGIS) for rider allocation and vendor discovery could lead to high API latency, causing a poor user experience and system bottlenecks under load.","Medium","High","[""CUS-010"",""RDR-010""]","","Ensure all geospatial columns have GIST indexes. Conduct mandatory query plan analysis for all spatial queries. Implement aggressive performance testing on discovery/allocation endpoints.","Develop a simpler, fallback allocation logic using coarse-grained zones, enabled via a feature flag.","P95 latency for geospatial API endpoints exceeding 200ms for more than 5 minutes.","","1 week to optimize queries"
