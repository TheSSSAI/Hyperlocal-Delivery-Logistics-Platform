"TEST-E2E-001","Order Placement","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end user journey of a customer placing a successful prepaid order, including vendor discovery, cart management, payment, and confirmation.","Critical - This is the primary revenue-generating flow of the platform.","High","Customer, Vendor, Rider accounts exist and are active. Vendor has products in stock. Customer has a valid payment method in Razorpay sandbox.","1. Customer logs in. 2. Searches for a vendor. 3. Adds an item to the cart. 4. Proceeds to checkout and confirms address. 5. Selects 'UPI' as payment method. 6. Completes payment in Razorpay test interface. 7. Verifies 'Order Placed' screen is shown in-app. 8. Verifies SMS and Push notification for confirmation are received.","Order is successfully created with status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'. Transaction is recorded. Notifications are sent. Customer sees confirmation screen.","Active Customer/Vendor/Rider test accounts, Razorpay sandbox credentials, Products with stock > 0.","Cypress (for customer web if applicable), Appium/Detox (for mobile), Razorpay Sandbox, Mock Notification Listener.","8","24","8","CUS-003, CUS-011, CUS-016, CUS-019, CUS-025, CUS-026","Staging environment with all microservices deployed and integrated with Razorpay sandbox.","100% test pass rate; Order created in under 5 seconds end-to-end; All notifications received.","Critical - Direct revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.","Every release, and on every change to Order, Payment, or Cart services.","High - Requires coordination across multiple user roles and product states.","Cancel the created test order.","Verify no sensitive payment data is logged. Verify payment signature on callback.","Entire flow should feel seamless to the user, with no step taking longer than 3 seconds.","N/A for automation, but manual check required as per WCAG 2.1 AA."
"TEST-INT-001","Order Creation Saga","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the Order Creation Saga's compensating transaction for a failed payment. The test ensures that if payment fails after inventory is reserved, the inventory is correctly released.","High - Saga failure can lead to inconsistent data (e.g., payment taken but order not created, or inventory locked incorrectly).","High","Order, Payment, and Vendor services are running. A message bus (SQS/SNS) is available. Product with limited stock exists.","1. Initiate the order creation process via API. 2. Mock the Payment service to return a 'payment_failed' event after the Vendor service has confirmed 'inventory_reserved'. 3. Monitor the message bus for the compensating event 'release_inventory'. 4. Verify the Vendor service consumes the event and releases the stock.","The final state of the product's inventory is returned to its original value. The order status is marked as 'Cancelled' or 'Failed'.","Product with a known stock quantity (e.g., 5).","Jest (for test runner), Supertest (for API calls), AWS SDK mocks (for SQS/SNS).","6","16","4","REQ-1-105, RISK-001","Integration test environment with services running in Docker and a local message bus (e.g., localstack).","100% pass rate; Inventory is correctly released; Final order state is consistent.","Critical - Inconsistent data, overselling or underselling stock, financial discrepancies.","On every change to the Order Creation Saga logic in any participating service.","Medium - Requires setting up a product and mocking service responses at specific steps.","Delete any intermediate order artifacts created during the test.","N/A","Saga should resolve (either success or full rollback) within 10 seconds.","N/A"
"TEST-SEC-001","Authentication","Security","API","Critical","true","High","Verify the account lockout mechanism for OTP-based login, ensuring the account is temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed attempts.","Critical - Failure to prevent brute-force attacks could lead to widespread account takeovers.","Medium","A valid customer account exists. The authentication service is running with Redis for state management.","1. Request an OTP for a valid mobile number. 2. Make 5 consecutive API calls to the OTP verification endpoint with an incorrect OTP. 3. On the 5th call, verify the API returns an error indicating account lockout. 4. Make a 6th call and verify it is also blocked. 5. Wait for the lockout period to expire. 6. Request a new OTP and verify it is successful.","Account is locked after 5 failed attempts, and all subsequent login attempts are blocked until the lockout period expires.","A valid customer mobile number.","Postman, k6, or a Jest/Supertest script.","4","12","2","CUS-005, REQ-1-041, REQ-1-096","Staging environment with Redis and a mechanism to read OTPs for testing.","Account locks on the 5th attempt; Account unlocks after the configured duration.","Critical - High security vulnerability to brute-force attacks.","Every release.","Low","Clear the lockout key in Redis for the test account.","This is a primary security test.","Each API call should be < 200ms.","N/A"
"TEST-PERF-001","Product Discovery","Performance","API","High","true","High","Verify the P95 latency of the 'Nearby Vendors' API under simulated peak load to ensure it meets the NFR.","High - Slow discovery is the first screen users see; poor performance leads to high bounce rates.","Medium","The performance environment is seeded with a large dataset of vendors (100,000+) across multiple geolocations.","1. Configure a load test script to hit the GET /api/v1/vendors/nearby endpoint. 2. Use a variety of lat/long coordinates as input. 3. Ramp up to 1000 requests per minute. 4. Maintain the load for 10 minutes. 5. Collect and analyze performance metrics.","The 95th percentile response time for the API remains under 200ms throughout the test. Error rate is less than 0.1%.","Large, realistic dataset of vendors with indexed geospatial data.","k6, JMeter, Grafana, Prometheus.","8","20","5","CUS-010, REQ-1-093, RISK-004","Dedicated, scalable performance testing environment with production-like specs.","P95 latency < 200ms; Error rate < 0.1%; CPU/Memory utilization remains within safe limits.","High - Poor user experience, potential for service degradation or outage under load.","Before every major release or after any significant change to the discovery service or database.","High","N/A","N/A","This is a primary performance test.","N/A"
