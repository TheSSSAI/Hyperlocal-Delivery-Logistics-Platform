## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-108

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system's observability stack shall consist of Prometheus for collecting metrics, Grafana for creating monitoring dashboards, and AWS CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging. All logs must be written in a structured JSON format. Distributed tracing shall be implemented across all microservices using the OpenTelemetry standard.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that Prometheus is scraping metrics from all microservices.
- Inspect logs in CloudWatch and confirm they are in a structured JSON format.
- Use a tracing tool (e.g., Jaeger, X-Ray) to visualize the complete distributed trace via OpenTelemetry.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The library must provide a logger implementation (e.g., wrapping Pino.js) that enforces structured JSON output.
- The library must integrate a Prometheus client (e.g., prom-client) to register and expose custom metrics via a standard '/metrics' endpoint.
- The library must initialize and configure the OpenTelemetry SDK for all services to enable distributed tracing.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary driver for the library's existence. The repository description explicitly states its purpose is to provide a standardized implementation for structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing using the specified technologies.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-109

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall use Prometheus Alertmanager for automated, real-time alerting on system health. Alerts must be configured for key metrics, including but not limited to: high API latency, high API error rates, high database connection pool utilization, message queue depth exceeding a threshold, abnormal pod CPU or memory usage, and high failure rates for third-party API calls.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that Alertmanager is configured with alerting rules for the specified key metrics.
- Simulate a high error rate on a critical API endpoint and verify that an alert is triggered.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The library must provide easy-to-use functions or decorators for services to create and update Prometheus metrics (counters, gauges, histograms) for application-specific events like API error rates and latency.
- It must expose the standard metrics that Alertmanager will consume to trigger alerts.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This library is the enabler for this requirement. It provides the instrumentation tools necessary for services to generate the key metrics upon which the alerting system depends.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-110

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system must implement distributed request tracing by ensuring every log entry contains a correlationId. For new incoming requests, this ID shall be generated at the API Gateway. The correlationId must then be propagated consistently through all subsequent synchronous API calls and asynchronous messages related to that initial request.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Filter logs by the correlationId generated for that request.
- Verify that logs from all involved services for that specific transaction appear in the filtered results.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The library must provide a NestJS middleware or interceptor to automatically extract the correlationId from incoming requests or generate a new one.
- The correlationId must be stored in a request-scoped context (e.g., using AsyncLocalStorage).
- The logger provided by the library must automatically enrich every log message with the correlationId from the context.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core, direct requirement for the library. The repository description explicitly states that one of its primary responsibilities is to ensure the correlationId is automatically propagated and included in all telemetry.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'platform-lib-observability', 'component_specification': 'A cross-cutting NestJS library that centralizes and standardizes observability practices. It provides a unified API for structured JSON logging, Prometheus metrics exposition, and OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing. It is responsible for enforcing consistent telemetry formats and propagating the correlationId across all backend services.', 'implementation_requirements': ['Must be packaged as a private NPM module for consumption by other backend services.', 'Must expose a configurable NestJS Module for easy integration.', 'Must provide a NestJS middleware for initializing tracing context and managing the correlationId.', 'Must include functionality to automatically mask sensitive fields in log data for security.'], 'architectural_context': "Operates within the 'Cross-Cutting Concerns' layer as a foundational library. It is a mandatory dependency for all backend microservices in the 'Application Services Layer'.", 'extraction_reasoning': 'This repository is the central component being analyzed. Its purpose is to implement key non-functional requirements related to observability, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication across the microservices architecture.'}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Cross-Cutting Concerns', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Handles functionalities applicable across multiple services, such as logging, tracing, security, and configuration management. These are implemented as shared libraries or through infrastructure-level tools like a service mesh.', 'layer_constraints': ['Components in this layer must not contain business-specific logic.', 'Libraries must be highly performant and resilient to avoid impacting the services that consume them.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Shared NPM libraries', 'NestJS Middleware/Interceptors', 'Dependency Injection'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The 'platform-lib-observability' repository is explicitly mapped to and is a direct implementation of the responsibilities defined for this architectural layer. It provides shared, standardized functionality for logging and tracing to all other services."}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'ILoggingContracts', 'source_repository': 'platform-lib-contracts', 'method_contracts': [], 'integration_pattern': 'Compile-Time Dependency', 'communication_protocol': 'N/A (Code-level import)', 'extraction_reasoning': 'This repository depends on platform-lib-contracts for shared, low-level data structures or TypeScript interfaces, such as standardized error classes or telemetry context definitions, to ensure that data passed to the logging functions is consistent across the platform.'}

###### 1.6.2.3.3.4 Implementation Requirements

Wraps the 'prom-client' library to create a histogram. Should provide sensible default buckets for latency measurements.

#### 1.6.2.4.0.0 Service Level Requirements

- Metric updates (e.g., incrementing a counter) must be highly performant and have negligible impact on request processing time.

#### 1.6.2.5.0.0 Implementation Constraints

- Metrics should be exposed via a standard '/metrics' endpoint, which the library helps to configure.

#### 1.6.2.6.0.0 Extraction Reasoning

This represents a key part of the library's public contract, enabling services to fulfill REQ-1-109.

## 1.7.0.0.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0.0.0 Framework Requirements

The library must be built as a NestJS module to align with the backend framework standard. It should leverage NestJS's dependency injection system to provide its logger and other utilities.

### 1.7.2.0.0.0 Integration Technologies

- Prometheus (prom-client): For creating and exposing application metrics.
- Pino.js: For high-performance, structured JSON logging.

### 1.7.3.0.0.0 Performance Constraints

Logging must be asynchronous to minimize its impact on API request latency. Metric updates must be low-overhead operations.

### 1.7.4.0.0.0 Security Requirements

The library must provide a mechanism to automatically mask or redact sensitive fields (e.g., 'password', 'token') within log context objects to prevent PII leakage into logs.
