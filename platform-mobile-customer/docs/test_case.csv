"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify that a registered Customer can successfully log in using a valid mobile number and a correct, unexpired OTP.","Critical - Login failure blocks all returning user engagement and revenue generation.","Medium","A registered and 'active' customer account exists. The authentication service and AWS SNS are operational. The customer mobile app is installed.","1. Launch the customer mobile app and navigate to the login screen. 2. Enter the registered mobile number. 3. Tap 'Send OTP'. 4. Retrieve the received OTP. 5. Enter the correct OTP into the app. 6. Tap 'Verify & Login'.","The user is successfully authenticated, a valid JWT is issued and stored securely, and the app navigates to the main vendor discovery screen. The entire process completes in under 3 seconds.","A pre-provisioned 'active' customer account with a known mobile number. A mechanism to intercept or read the OTP in the test environment.","Detox/Appium (Mobile E2E); Mock service for AWS SNS; Postman (for API verification).","2","12","4","CUS-001 (Registration); Identity & Access Service; AWS SNS.","Staging environment with all microservices deployed and integrated with AWS SNS sandbox.","100% test pass rate for this critical path. P95 latency for the entire flow < 3s. JWT is validated and active.","Critical - Blocks all returning user access.","Every build","Medium","Invalidate the user's session token after the test run.","OTP must be single-use. JWTs must be securely stored and transmitted.","Login API P95 latency < 200ms.","All login form elements must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant."
"TEST-ORDER-001","Order Placement","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end flow of a customer placing a successful prepaid order, ensuring data consistency across Order, Payment, and Vendor services via the Saga pattern.","Critical - Failure in this flow directly impacts revenue and customer trust.","High","Customer is logged in. At least one vendor with an in-stock product is 'Online'. Payment gateway (Razorpay) sandbox is available.","1. Customer adds an item to the cart. 2. Customer proceeds to checkout and selects an address. 3. Customer selects 'UPI' as payment method. 4. System performs pre-payment stock check. 5. Customer is redirected to Razorpay sandbox and authorizes payment. 6. Customer is redirected back to the app's confirmation screen. 7. Vendor receives a real-time notification for the new order.","Order is created in 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' state. A transaction record is created in the Payment service. An 'OrderCreated' event is published. Vendor receives the order. Customer sees the confirmation screen.","Active Customer, Vendor, and Product data.

All Saga steps complete successfully. No revenue loss.","Critical - Revenue loss, poor customer experience, data inconsistency.","Every build","High","Cancel the created test order. Reset inventory.","PCI-DSS compliance must be maintained. Webhook signatures must be validated.","Order creation P95 latency < 1000ms.","Checkout flow must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant."
"TEST-LOGISTICS-001","Rider Logistics","Performance","System","High","true","High","Validate that the Rider Allocation algorithm meets the P95 latency target of under 30 seconds with a high volume of concurrent online riders and incoming orders.","High - Slow allocation leads to delivery delays, poor customer experience, and inefficient rider utilization.","High","Performance test environment is provisioned with a scaled-up RDS PostGIS instance. A large dataset of riders is seeded.","1. Seed the database with 10,000 'Online' riders at random coordinates within a test operational zone. 2. Use a load generator to simulate 100 new 'OrderReadyForPickup' events per minute. 3. The Rider Allocation service consumes these events and performs the allocation. 4. Measure the time from event consumption to a rider being assigned.","The 95th percentile of the allocation duration remains under 30 seconds. The database CPU utilization remains below 80%.","A large, realistic dataset of rider locations and statuses. A stream of order events.","k6/JMeter (Load Generator); Prometheus/Grafana (Monitoring); A data generation script.","8","20","6","SYS-002 (Allocation Algorithm); Rider Logistics Service; Performance Environment.","Dedicated, isolated performance testing environment.","P95 allocation time < 30s. System remains stable under target load.","High - Platform cannot scale to meet demand.","Every major release","High","Tear down load generators.

"TEST-SEC-001","Admin Dashboard","Security","System","Critical","true","High","Verify that a low-privilege user (e.g., Vendor) cannot access or modify data via an Admin API endpoint due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.","Critical - A breach could lead to mass data leakage, unauthorized system changes, and severe reputational and legal damage.","Medium","An active 'Admin' user account and an active 'Vendor' user account exist. An admin-only API endpoint (e.g., `PATCH /admin/users/{userId}/suspend`) exists.","1. Authenticate as the 'Vendor' user and obtain a valid JWT. 2. Using an API client, construct a request to the admin-only endpoint to suspend the 'Admin' user's account, using the Vendor's JWT for authorization. 3. Send the request.","The API Gateway and/or the microservice's authorization guard must reject the request with a 403 Forbidden status code. No change is made to the target user's account.
