# 3 Description

This repository contains the complete React Native source code for the customer-facing mobile application. Its primary responsibility is to provide the user interface and experience for customers to discover local vendors, browse products, place orders, make payments, track live deliveries, and provide ratings. This application is a core component of the three-sided marketplace, serving as the primary touchpoint for the consumer user class. It integrates with the backend via the centralized API Gateway. Its dependencies on shared libraries have been updated to consume the new, granular components for UI consistency and API access.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The repository's core responsibility as a standalone customer application remains unchanged. However, its internal structure is optimized by extracting shared logic into 'platform-ui-components' and 'platform-api-client', reducing its codebase size, eliminating duplicated code, and improving maintainability.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Shared UI components are now consumed from REPO-UI-COMPONENTS.
- API data fetching logic is now handled by REPO-API-CLIENT.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a top-level application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- The development team can focus purely on customer-facing features and user experience.
- Builds are faster due to a smaller, more focused codebase.
