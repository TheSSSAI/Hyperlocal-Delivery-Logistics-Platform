# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Order Management Service
- Scheduler
- Message Bus
- Notification Service
- Payment Service
- Vendor Service

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Scheduling a delayed task
- Checking order status
- Updating order status to 'Cancelled'
- Publishing an 'OrderAutoRejected' event
- Sending notifications
- Initiating a refund

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Is the order status still 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'?
- Was the order prepaid?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Order is correctly identified as timed-out, status is updated, and all downstream actions (notification, refund) are triggered.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- The order was already accepted or rejected by the vendor, in which case the timeout action is aborted.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Race condition where a vendor acts just as the timer expires is handled by the initial status check.
