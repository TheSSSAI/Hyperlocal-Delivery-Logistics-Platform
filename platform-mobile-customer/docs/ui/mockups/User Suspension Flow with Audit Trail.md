# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

User Suspension Flow with Audit Trail

## 1.2 Diagram Type

sequenceDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

To provide a detailed technical specification for the user suspension flow initiated by an administrator. This sequence guarantees that any action modifying a user's status is transactionally coupled with the creation of an immutable audit record, fulfilling the compliance requirements of REQ-USR-001 and REQ-NFR-008. The entire operation is atomic; failure to write to the audit log results in a complete rollback of the user status change.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- QA engineers
- security auditors
- architects

## 1.5 Complexity Level

high

## 1.6 Estimated Review Time

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Administrator
- Admin Web Dashboard
- API Gateway
- Identity & Access Service
- PostgreSQL Database
- Message Bus (SNS/SQS)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Two-step UI confirmation
- JWT Authentication & Authorization
- Atomic Database Transaction
- Status Update
- Immutable Audit Logging
- Asynchronous Event Publication

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Admin confirms action in UI
- Database transaction success/failure

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Admin successfully suspends a user, which is reflected in the database and logged in the audit trail.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- JWT is invalid or does not have Admin role
- Database transaction fails (e.g., audit log insertion fails), leading to a full rollback.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Ensuring atomicity of the core business logic (status update) and the compliance requirement (audit log).

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram if the session invalidation mechanism changes or if additional steps are added to the suspension process.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed this diagram directly within the technical documentation for the Identity & Access service and link it from the relevant user stories (ADM-006) and requirements (REQ-USR-001, REQ-NFR-008).
