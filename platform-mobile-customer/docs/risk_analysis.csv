"RISK-001","Technical","Data inconsistency across microservices (Orders, Payments, Logistics) due to the failure of a step in the distributed Saga transaction pattern. This could lead to a customer being charged for an order that is never sent to the vendor.","4","5","20","High","WI-004-01-03 (Order Creation), WI-006-01-02 (Payment Intent), VND-022 (Vendor Cancels Order)","The inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across distributed systems without 2PC. A bug in a compensating transaction or a failed event publication can leave the system in an inconsistent state.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern for all event-publishing services to ensure atomicity between database state changes and event emissions. Enforce rigorous integration testing for all Saga compensating transactions (e.g., refund on failure).","Develop an administrative dashboard to identify and display orders stuck in an intermediate state for more than a configured period (e.g., 10 minutes). Implement a manual retry or resolution (cancel/refund) mechanism for these orders.","Prometheus alert fires when the count of orders in 'payment_pending_confirmation' or other transient states exceeds a threshold for longer than 15 minutes. An alert on the SQS dead-letter queue depth for Saga-related events.","Lead Backend Architect","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","A critical third-party API (Razorpay for payments or Mapbox for routing) experiences a major outage or high latency, directly halting the platform's ability to process new orders or dispatch riders, leading to significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.","3","5","15","High","CUS-025 (Customer Completes Online Payment), RDR-011 (Rider Views Task Details), RDR-017 (Rider Uses In-App Navigation)","Over-reliance on external, single-source dependencies for core business functions (payment processing and logistics routing) without a built-in fallback mechanism.","Implement robust circuit breaker patterns on all critical external API calls. For payments, if Razorpay fails, automatically disable online payments and fall back to allowing only Cash on Delivery (COD) orders if operationally feasible. For mapping, cache vendor locations aggressively.","If the Mapbox API is down, disable new order placement and display a global banner on the customer app stating the service is temporarily unavailable. Have a pre-defined runbook for communicating with stakeholders and monitoring the third-party's status page.","Alertmanager rule triggers on a spike (e.g., >20%) in 5xx error rates from API calls to `api.razorpay.com` or `api.mapbox.com` over a 5-minute window.","Senior DevOps Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","Significant skill gaps within the development team for highly specialized technologies like PostGIS geospatial querying, AWS App Mesh configuration, or distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry, leading to suboptimal implementation, performance bottlenecks, and project delays.","4","4","16","High","WI-005-01-04 (Rider Allocation Algorithm), WI-001-01-04 (AWS App Mesh Setup), WI-009-01-04 (Distributed Tracing)","The project's technology stack is both broad and deep, requiring expert-level knowledge in multiple niche domains which may not be present across the entire team.","Conduct a formal skills assessment. Schedule targeted training sessions or workshops. Mandate pair programming for complex tasks and enforce a strict code review policy where critical modules are reviewed by the designated subject-matter expert or Tech Lead.","Allocate a budget for an external consultant to conduct architecture reviews for the most complex components (logistics, service mesh) and provide short-term implementation support if internal velocity drops.","High rate of pull request comments/rejections or an increase in bug density for modules related to these technologies. Slippage of deadlines for tasks involving these technologies for two consecutive sprints.","Engineering Manager","2025-01-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The rider allocation algorithm's geospatial query performance degrades significantly under production load (e.g., 10k+ online riders), causing the allocation time to exceed the 30-second P95 target, leading to delivery delays and failed allocations.","3","5","15","High","WI-005-01-04 (Rider Allocation Algorithm), REQ-1-093 (Performance Targets)","Inefficient PostGIS query design or missing spatial indexes (GIST) on the rider location table, which does not scale linearly with the number of active riders.","Proactively performance test the allocation query using a large, seeded dataset. Ensure all geospatial columns have GIST indexes. Implement a multi-level filtering strategy: first query for riders in a wider bounding box, then perform precise distance calculations in-memory for the smaller subset.","Develop a simplified, fallback 'broadcast' allocation method that pushes the task to all riders within a certain radius via a geospatial pub/sub system (like Redis GEO). This can be activated via a feature flag if the primary algorithm is failing.","Grafana dashboard shows the P95 latency for the rider allocation API endpoint consistently exceeding 20 seconds. An alert is triggered if the allocation success rate drops below 98%.","Lead Logistics Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Security","A security vulnerability in an admin-level endpoint, such as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), or a misconfigured RBAC guard allows a low-privilege user (e.g., Vendor) to access or modify data belonging to other users or the entire system.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-008-01-01 (Admin User Management), WI-003-02-02 (Product CRUD), REQ-1-096 (Authorization)","Incomplete or incorrect implementation of authorization checks in the service layer, where the system only checks for authentication (a valid token) but not for ownership of the requested resource.","Implement a standardized authorization guard or interceptor in NestJS that is applied to all sensitive endpoints. Mandate that all data modification/deletion services must check that the resource being acted upon belongs to the authenticated user's scope (e.g., `WHERE id = :id AND vendor_id = :vendorId`).","In case of a breach, have a runbook to immediately rotate credentials, revoke compromised session tokens, and use the immutable audit trail (REQ-1-013) to assess the scope of the unauthorized actions. Isolate the affected service.","A spike in 403 Forbidden errors in API Gateway logs could indicate attempts to exploit authorization flaws. The annual third-party penetration test (REQ-1-098) is a key detective control.","Lead Security Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The data replication pipeline from the primary RDS databases to the Amazon OpenSearch index experiences significant latency or fails, resulting in stale search results and inaccurate administrative reports. This erodes user trust and undermines business intelligence capabilities.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-008-02-02 (Data Pipeline to OpenSearch), CUS-011 (Customer Searches), ADM-026 (Admin Reports)","The complexity of the data transformation logic in the ETL/DMS job, or network bottlenecks between RDS and OpenSearch, causing the replication lag to grow beyond the 24-hour target.","Implement comprehensive monitoring on the data pipeline (e.g., AWS DMS metrics). Create a separate, scheduled data validation job that compares record counts and checksums between the source and destination to detect inconsistencies.","If the pipeline fails, the Reporting API should have a fallback mechanism to either serve a cached version of the last known good report or return a message indicating that reporting data is temporarily unavailable. The search feature might show a similar banner.","A CloudWatch alert is triggered if the AWS DMS replication latency metric exceeds a threshold of 12 hours. The data validation job fails, indicating a data mismatch.","Data Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
