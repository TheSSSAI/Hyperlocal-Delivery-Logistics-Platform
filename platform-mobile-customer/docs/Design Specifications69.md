#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly maps to the core feature set of the customer app, as detailed in numerous user stories (CUS-006, CUS-039, CUS-013, CUS-037).

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

End-to-end latency for real-time location updates under 2 seconds (REQ-1-061); P95 API latency under 200ms (REQ-1-093).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The application must efficiently process WebSocket messages for the map view. State management updates triggered by API calls must be optimized to prevent UI lag. Use of virtualized lists for long data sets (e.g., order history) is mandatory.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Use performant state management libraries (e.g., Zustand or well-structured Redux Toolkit).
- Implement memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Meeting these NFRs is critical for a smooth user experience, especially for core features like live tracking and product discovery.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Client of API Gateway

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The mobile app acts as a client to the backend, funneling all network requests through a single, unified API Gateway. It is unaware of the underlying microservice architecture.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- Shared API Client Library (from REPO-API-CLIENT)
- Configuration Module (for API Gateway URL)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The application will instantiate and configure the API client from the shared library at startup. All data-fetching hooks and services will use this client instance, which will handle authentication headers, token refreshing, and error mapping.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern, mandated by the overall system architecture (REQ-1-106), simplifies client-side configuration, centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication, and decouples the client from the backend's internal structure.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

State Management (Server & Client)

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

A clear separation is maintained between server state (data fetched from the API) and client state (UI state, cart contents).

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- React Query or RTK Query (for server state)
- Redux Toolkit or Zustand (for client state)

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Use React Query/RTK Query to handle API data fetching, caching, and invalidation. Use Redux/Zustand for managing the shopping cart, user session, and global UI state. For offline support (REQ-1-087), a persistence middleware (e.g., Redux Persist) will be used to save parts of the store to local storage.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This separation is a best practice in modern React applications. It simplifies logic by using specialized tools for each type of state, improving performance and maintainability.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- The app must conform to the 'IApiClient' interface provided by the shared 'REPO-API-CLIENT' library.
- All data exchanged with the API must match the DTOs defined in the shared library.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary integration point for all data and actions. Using a shared, typed client library enforces consistency and type safety.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Push Notifications

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern
