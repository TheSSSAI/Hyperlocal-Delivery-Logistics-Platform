# 3 Description

This microservice repository handles all aspects of physical delivery logistics. Its core responsibilities include managing rider availability, running the rider allocation algorithm to assign tasks, providing real-time location tracking for live orders, optimizing delivery routes, and managing operational zones via geofencing. It is a highly specialized service that integrates deeply with the third-party mapping provider (Mapbox). The logic is complex and computationally intensive, justifying its separation. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new granular shared libraries.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Logistics is a classic, complex domain that forms a natural bounded context. Its requirementsâ€”real-time geospatial calculations, route optimization, and high-frequency location updatesâ€”are technologically distinct from other services. Isolating it allows for specialized technology choices (like the PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL) and performance tuning focused on its unique workload, without impacting the rest of the system.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The core allocation and routing algorithms could potentially be reused in other logistics-based systems.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- A dedicated team can build deep expertise in logistics and geospatial technologies.
- The computationally intensive allocation algorithm can be scaled independently.
