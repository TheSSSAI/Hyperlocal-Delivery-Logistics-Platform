"US-ORD-002","Order Lifecycle Management","Implement Order State Machine with Immutable Event Logging","Administrator","As an Administrator, I want the system to enforce a strict order lifecycle using a state machine and record every status change in an immutable log, so that I can ensure data integrity, trace an order's history, and resolve disputes.","Guarantees data consistency and provides a complete audit trail for all orders, which is critical for operational support, dispute resolution, and debugging.

"US-ORD-003","Order Lifecycle Management","System Creates and Validates New Orders via a Transactional API","System","As the System, I want to process a new order creation request by validating the data, checking inventory in real-time, and creating an order in a 'pending payment' state, so that a customer's purchase can be initiated reliably and consistently across multiple services.","Enables the critical first step of the order lifecycle.

"US-ORD-004","Order Lifecycle Management","System Updates Order Status from External Service Events","System","As the System, I want the Order Management service to consume events from other services (like Payments and Logistics), so that the order's status accurately reflects real-world events such as a confirmed payment or a failed delivery allocation.","Ensures the order status is the single source of truth by reacting to events from across the platform.

"US-ORD-005","Order Lifecycle Management","System Publishes Order Status Changes as Events","System","As the System, I want the Order Management service to reliably publish an event whenever an order's status changes, so that other microservices (like Notifications, Rider Logistics, and Vendor) can be triggered to perform their respective actions.","Decouples the Order service from other platform components, enabling a scalable and resilient event-driven architecture. This allows for the development of features like real-time notifications and rider dispatching.","Must Have","5","[""US-ORD-002""]","[{""scenario"":""Publish 'OrderReadyForPickup' event"",""given"":""a vendor has marked an order as ready for pickup"",""when"":""the order's status is successfully updated to 'Ready for Pickup' in the database"",""then"":""an `OrderReadyForPickup` event is reliably published to the designated SNS topic.""},{""scenario"":""Publish 'OrderCancelled' event"",""given"":""a customer has cancelled an order"",""when"":""the order's status is successfully updated to 'Cancelled'"",""then"":""an `OrderCancelled` event is reliably published to the designated SNS topic.""},{""scenario"":""Event publishing is atomic with database updates"",""given"":""the system is processing a status change"",""when"":""the database transaction to update the order status fails"",""then"":""no event is published to the SNS topic, ensuring consistency."",""and"":""when the database transaction succeeds, the event is guaranteed to be published (e.g., via Transactional Outbox pattern).""}]","[""Implement Event Publishers for Order State Changes""]","[""A `MessagingService` is implemented to handle publishing to SNS."",""The Transactional Outbox pattern is implemented to guarantee event delivery upon successful DB transaction."",""Unit tests verify that the correct event payloads are generated for each state change."",""Integration tests verify that events are published to a mock or test SNS topic.""]"
