"RISK-001","Timeline","Underestimation of integration complexity between microservices (Order, Payments, Rider Logistics) leads to significant critical path delays, pushing out the pilot launch date. The Saga pattern and asynchronous eventing add hidden complexity.","4","4","16","High","End-to-end order processing, rider allocation, financial settlement features. User stories like CUS-025 (Payment), VND-021 (Ready for Pickup), and RDR-012 (Accept Task).","Each service appears manageable in isolation, but the dependencies and coordination required for distributed transactions (Saga pattern) are often underestimated by teams new to microservices.","Conduct mandatory technical spikes for each cross-service feature before sprint planning. Enforce strict API contract definition and versioning from day one. Implement consumer-driven contract testing to catch breaking changes early in the CI/CD pipeline.","Maintain a prioritized backlog of features. If a complex integration is delayed, re-plan sprints to focus on independent features and be prepared to de-scope non-critical functionality to protect the launch date for the core order flow.","A key integration user story (e.g., CUS-025) exceeds its pessimistic time estimate by more than 20%, or contract tests fail for more than two consecutive days.","Project Manager","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure in the distributed Saga transaction for order creation (REQ-1-105) results in data inconsistency, such as a payment being captured but no order being created, or inventory not being decremented, leading to direct revenue loss and a poor customer experience.","3","5","15","High","Core order placement (CUS-025), payment processing (REQ-1-003), and inventory management (REQ-1-006). This failure corrupts the most critical business transaction.","The inherent complexity of ensuring atomicity across distributed services without 2PC. A bug in a compensating transaction or a failure to publish an event after a database commit can leave the system in an inconsistent state.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern to guarantee event publishing upon a successful database commit. Develop robust, idempotent compensating transactions for every step of the Saga. Create extensive integration tests that specifically simulate failures at each step (e.g., payment API fails, inventory update fails) and verify correct rollback.","Develop an administrative dashboard to view, flag, and manually resolve failed Sagas. Configure critical alerts in Prometheus/Alertmanager for a high rate of Saga failures, triggering an on-call incident response.","The rate of failed or incomplete order Sagas exceeds 0.5% of total order creation attempts within a 1-hour window.","Backend Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","The development team lacks sufficient expertise or has a key-person dependency in critical, complex technologies such as Kubernetes/EKS, PostGIS for geospatial queries, or implementing the Saga pattern, leading to poor quality implementations, security vulnerabilities, or project delays.","4","4","16","High","Infrastructure setup (REQ-1-018), vendor discovery (CUS-010), order creation (CUS-025), and overall system stability and scalability.","The project mandates a modern but highly complex technology stack (REQ-1-111) that requires specialized, cross-domain knowledge which may not be evenly distributed across the team.","Conduct a formal team skills matrix assessment. Invest in targeted training and workshops for Kubernetes, distributed systems patterns, and PostGIS. Enforce mandatory pair programming and rigorous code reviews for all critical infrastructure and service components. Create detailed architectural decision records (ADRs) and pattern documentation.","Retain a specialized cloud-native/distributed systems consultant on a flexible contract for periodic architectural reviews and to be on-call for critical production issues during the initial launch phase.","Sprint velocity drops by over 25% for two consecutive sprints involving these complex technologies. Code reviews consistently reveal fundamental misunderstandings of the core architectural patterns.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","A major outage or significant performance degradation of a critical third-party service, such as the Razorpay payment gateway or the Mapbox mapping service (REQ-1-090), renders the entire platform non-operational, stopping revenue generation and/or delivery logistics.","2","5","10","Medium","All user stories involving payment (CUS-025), payouts (SYS-006), navigation (RDR-014, RDR-017), geofencing (ADM-013), and live tracking (CUS-028).","The business model is fundamentally dependent on external services for core functionalities (payments and logistics), creating single points of failure outside the team's direct control.","Implement and thoroughly test resilience patterns for all third-party integrations as per REQ-1-028, including robust circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries with exponential backoff. Design UI to gracefully degrade (e.g., disable payment/delivery options) when a service is unavailable.","Develop and maintain a documented runbook for a prolonged third-party outage, including customer communication templates and a 'maintenance mode' switch. Have a preliminary technical evaluation of an alternative provider for both payments and mapping on file.","Prometheus alert fires for a sustained API error rate of over 5% for any critical third-party service for more than 10 minutes.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The system fails to meet the strict performance NFRs (e.g., P95 API latency < 200ms) under real-world production load, leading to a poor user experience, high cart abandonment rates, and rider frustration.","3","4","12","Medium","Core user flows: Search (CUS-011), Add to Cart (CUS-016), Checkout (CUS-025), and Rider task acceptance (RDR-012).","Inefficient database queries (especially geospatial), chatty inter-service communication, or inadequate resource allocation in the Kubernetes cluster.","Integrate performance testing (e.g., using k6 or JMeter) into the CI/CD pipeline. Conduct regular load tests against the staging environment. Implement observability with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) to identify bottlenecks early. Optimize critical database queries and cache frequently accessed, non-volatile data in Redis.","If performance targets are missed pre-launch, allocate a dedicated 'performance tuning' sprint. Vertically or horizontally scale cloud resources (EKS nodes, RDS instances) as a short-term fix while root-cause analysis is underway.","Staging environment load tests show P95 latency exceeding the 200ms NFR by 25% or more.","QA Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","A security vulnerability in the authentication/authorization flow or improper handling of PII leads to a data breach, exposing sensitive user data (REQ-1-022) and violating DPDP Act compliance (REQ-1-021), resulting in severe reputational damage and legal penalties.","2","5","10","Medium","All features handling user data, including Registration (CUS-001), Profile Management (CUS-006), and any API endpoint that returns user information.","Incorrect implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in microservices, vulnerabilities in dependencies, or insecure configuration of cloud services like AWS Cognito or S3.","Enforce RBAC checks at both the API Gateway and within each microservice. Mandate automated vulnerability scanning for code dependencies and container images in the CI/CD pipeline (REQ-1-098). Conduct a formal third-party penetration test before launch. All PII access must be logged to an immutable audit trail.","Develop and drill an incident response plan for a data breach, including steps for containment, forensic analysis, user notification, and reporting to regulatory authorities.","A 'Critical' or 'High' vulnerability is detected by the automated scanner in the CI/CD pipeline. Any suspicious access patterns are detected in the audit logs.","Security Lead","2024-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","The disaster recovery plan for the primary PostgreSQL database fails to meet the RTO (<15 min) or RPO (<5 min) objectives (REQ-1-094) during a real incident, leading to extended downtime and significant data loss.","2","5","10","Medium","The entire platform, as the RDS database is a critical stateful component for nearly all services.","Misconfiguration of AWS RDS Multi-AZ failover, backup retention policies, or application inability to reconnect to the new database endpoint after a failover.","Automate the setup of RDS Multi-AZ, automated snapshots, and point-in-time recovery using Terraform. Applications must be configured with a connection timeout and retry logic. Conduct mandatory, scheduled disaster recovery drills quarterly in the staging environment.","Maintain a detailed, step-by-step runbook for both automated and manual database failover procedures. Ensure on-call engineers are trained on this runbook.","AWS CloudWatch alert for the primary database instance becoming unavailable. Automated DR drill fails or exceeds RTO/RPO targets.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","Uncontrolled scaling behavior in EKS, inefficient database queries, or excessive logging leads to significant cloud infrastructure cost overruns, jeopardizing the project's budget and long-term financial viability.","4","3","12","Medium","Overall project budget and operational expenditure. Affects all deployed services.","Lack of cost monitoring and governance. Misconfiguration of Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers or Cluster Autoscaler. Retaining debug-level logs in production.","Implement AWS Budgets with alerts for cost anomalies. Use tools like Kubecost or OpenCost to monitor per-service costs within the EKS cluster. Enforce strict logging levels for production environments. Conduct regular cost optimization reviews of all AWS resources.","If costs exceed budget, prioritize optimization tasks, such as query tuning or switching to AWS Graviton instances. Be prepared to resize or scale down non-production environments.","AWS Budget alert indicates that the projected monthly spend is >10% over the allocated budget.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-20","Not Started"
