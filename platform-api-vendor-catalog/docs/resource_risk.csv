"RISK-001","Technical","Complexity of Choreographed Saga pattern for order creation could lead to inconsistent states, financial loss, and significant debugging effort.","High","Critical","[""OMS-003"",""OMS-006""]","2","Implement Transactional Outbox pattern and create a Saga Monitoring Dashboard.","Develop admin runbook for manually reconciling failed sagas; use DLQs with P2 alerts.","Messages in DLQ > 0; Orders stuck in 'payment_pending_confirmation' > 10 mins.","8000","Ongoing"
"RISK-002","External","Synchronous API calls to Vendor and Payments services will block all new orders if those services are down or latent.","Medium","Critical","[""OMS-004"",""OMS-005""]","","Implement robust circuit breakers with aggressive timeouts (<1s) and graceful degradation.","Operational runbook to manually disable order creation via a feature flag during extended outages.","Circuit breaker is in 'Open' state; spike in 5xx errors for checkout API.","","Immediate"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Delays in API development from dependent Vendor and Payments teams will block the critical order creation workflow.","High","High","[""OMS-004"",""OMS-005""]","2","Establish formal API contracts (OpenAPI) and use consumer-driven contract testing (Pact). Develop against mock servers.","Develop dependent logic behind a feature flag; escalate timeline risks to project management.","Failing contract tests in CI pipeline; weekly sync meetings reveal slippage.","","1 week"
"RISK-004","Quality","Incomplete or incorrect observability implementation will make debugging distributed system failures extremely difficult and time-consuming, increasing MTTR.","High","High","[""All""]","","Treat observability as a mandatory feature. Enforce structured logging with correlation IDs, OpenTelemetry spans, and Prometheus metrics in all PRs.","Rely on manual cross-referencing of correlation IDs across CloudWatch log groups.","Code reviews reveal lack of instrumentation; inability to trace a request's lifecycle within 15 mins during a test incident.","","Ongoing"
"RISK-005","Technical","A bug in the complex finite state machine for the order lifecycle could cause orders to become stuck in an unrecoverable state, requiring manual intervention.","Medium","High","[""OMS-007"",""OMS-008"",""OMS-009""]","1","Use a standard state machine library (e.g., XState). Mandate 100% test coverage for all state transitions.","Develop a secure admin API to manually force-transition a stuck order to a safe terminal state, with heavy auditing.","Alert when an order remains in a transient state for longer than a defined threshold (e.g., 3 hours).","5000","4 weeks"
"RISK-006","Operational","The CI/CD pipeline is a single point of failure. A misconfiguration or flaky test could block all new features and bug fixes from being released.","Medium","High","[""OMS-INF-004""]","1","Implement a manual approval gate before production deployment. Use version pinning for all pipeline dependencies. Implement automated rollback capabilities.","Maintain a documented, up-to-date manual deployment runbook as an emergency fallback.","CI/CD pipeline failure rate exceeds 15% for reasons other than code quality issues.","2000","2 weeks"
