"RISK-001","Technical","The Choreographed Saga pattern (REQ-1-105) for order creation is highly complex. A bug in event handlers, compensating transactions, or event bus integration could lead to inconsistent states (e.g., payment taken but order not confirmed), resulting in financial loss and significant debugging effort.","4","5","20","High","OMS-003, OMS-006, WS-002: Entire Order Creation Saga. This affects the core revenue-generating process of the platform.","Inherent complexity of managing distributed transactions asynchronously across multiple microservices without a central orchestrator.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern to guarantee event emission upon database commit. Develop a comprehensive suite of integration tests covering the full saga flow, including all failure and compensation paths. Create a 'Saga Monitoring Dashboard' to visualize the state of in-flight transactions.","Develop an administrative runbook and tooling for manually reconciling failed or stuck sagas. Configure Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for all saga-related SQS queues to capture failed events and trigger a P2 alert for on-call engineers to investigate.","Alertmanager alert is triggered when the message count in any saga-related DLQ is greater than zero. A custom dashboard shows an increasing number of orders stuck in 'payment_pending_confirmation' state for more than 10 minutes.","Backend Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The critical path for new order creation includes synchronous API calls to the Vendor service (inventory check) and Payments service (payment intent). High latency or downtime in either of these dependent services will directly block all new orders, causing a complete outage of the platform's core business function.","3","5","15","High","OMS-004 (Inventory Check), OMS-005 (Payment Intent Creation). This risk impacts the entire customer checkout experience.","Tight coupling with external microservices in a time-sensitive, user-facing workflow.","Implement robust, configurable circuit breakers with aggressive timeouts (e.g., <1 second) on all synchronous inter-service calls as required by REQ-1-028. Implement a graceful degradation fallback mechanism, such as temporarily disabling the checkout button and displaying a 'High Traffic' message if a dependency is unavailable.","Create an operational runbook to manually disable the order creation feature via a feature flag if a dependent service is confirmed to be down for an extended period (>5 minutes). This prevents user frustration and a buildup of failed requests.","Alertmanager alert fires when the circuit breaker for either the Vendor or Payments service API call is in the 'Open' state. A spike in 5xx error rates for the `POST /api/v1/orders/checkout` endpoint.","DevOps/SRE Lead","2024-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The Order Management Service has hard, synchronous dependencies on APIs from the Vendor and Payments services. Any delay in the development, deployment, or documentation of these external APIs will directly block the implementation and testing of the critical order creation workflow (WS-002), jeopardizing the project timeline.","4","4","16","High","OMS-004, OMS-005. The entire Epic 'Core Order Lifecycle Management' (EPIC-001) is at risk of delay.","Inter-team dependencies in a parallel development environment without strictly enforced contracts.","Establish and version a formal API contract (using OpenAPI) with dependency teams immediately. Implement consumer-driven contract testing (e.g., using Pact) in the CI pipeline to detect breaking changes early. Develop against a mock server based on the agreed contract to decouple development timelines.","If a dependency is delayed, develop the dependent logic behind a feature flag, allowing the rest of the service to be deployed and tested. Escalate timeline risks to project management immediately if contract milestones are missed.","Contract tests in the CI pipeline begin to fail. Weekly cross-team sync meetings reveal timeline slippage from a dependency team.","Project Manager","2024-06-30","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Quality","The implementation of comprehensive observability (structured logging, distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics) is complex. If incomplete or incorrect, debugging failures in the distributed system—especially the Saga—will be extremely difficult and time-consuming, significantly increasing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) for production incidents.","4","4","16","High","All work items. This is a cross-cutting concern that impacts the entire service's operational readiness.","Observability is often treated as a low-priority, 'nice-to-have' feature, and its complexity in a distributed environment is underestimated.","Treat observability as a first-class, mandatory feature. Enforce in PR reviews that all new endpoints and event handlers include structured logging with correlation IDs, OpenTelemetry spans, and relevant Prometheus metrics. Create a 'Definition of Done' that includes verification of dashboards and traces.","In the absence of distributed tracing, engineers will have to rely on manually cross-referencing correlation IDs across CloudWatch log groups, which is slow and error-prone but serves as a last-resort debugging method.","Code review of new features reveals a lack of instrumentation. During a test incident, an engineer is unable to trace a request's full lifecycle across services within 15 minutes.","Tech Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The finite state machine for the order lifecycle (OMS-007) is complex, with numerous states and transitions. A subtle bug in the transition logic or failure to handle an edge case could cause orders to become stuck in an unrecoverable state, requiring manual database intervention and causing customer support incidents.","3","4","12","Medium","OMS-007, OMS-008, OMS-009. Affects the integrity of all orders processed by the system.","Complexity of the state graph and the potential for events to arrive out of order in a distributed system.","Implement the state machine using a well-tested, standard library (e.g., XState) rather than a custom ad-hoc implementation. Generate a visual state graph from the code to aid in reviews. Mandate 100% test coverage for all valid and invalid state transitions.","Develop a secure admin API endpoint that allows an authorized operator to manually force-transition a stuck order to a safe terminal state (e.g., 'Cancelled'). Every use of this tool must be heavily audited.","Alertmanager alert fires when an order remains in a transient state (e.g., 'Preparing') for longer than a defined threshold (e.g., 3 hours). An increase in customer support tickets related to 'stuck' orders.","Backend Lead (Order Service)","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The CI/CD pipeline, involving GitHub Actions and Terraform for EKS deployments, is a complex single point of failure for getting code to production. A misconfiguration, flaky test, or security vulnerability in the pipeline could either deploy a broken service or completely block all new features and bug fixes from being released.","3","4","12","Medium","OMS-INF-004. This impacts the entire team's development velocity and ability to respond to incidents.","Complexity of modern GitOps deployment pipelines and the numerous tools involved.","Implement the pipeline with distinct, well-defined stages. Initially, include a manual approval gate before the production deployment stage. Use version pinning for all GitHub Actions and dependencies. Implement automated rollback capabilities within the deployment strategy.","Maintain a documented, up-to-date manual deployment runbook as an emergency fallback. Ensure at least two team members are trained on this process. Store the last known stable deployment artifact for quick redeployment.","CI/CD pipeline failure rate exceeds 15% for reasons other than code quality issues. The average pipeline execution time increases by more than 50% over a one-week period.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-10","Not Started"
