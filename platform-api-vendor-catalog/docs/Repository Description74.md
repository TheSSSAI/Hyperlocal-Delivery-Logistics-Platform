# 3 Description

This microservice repository manages all data related to vendors and their offerings. Its responsibilities include vendor profiles, business hours, license details, the product catalog (products and categories), and real-time inventory management. It provides the core data needed for the customer's product discovery experience and is a critical component for vendors to manage their store. This service is designed for a high-read, moderate-write workload. Its dependencies are updated to use the new granular shared libraries.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository represents the well-defined 'Vendor & Catalog' bounded context from DDD. Separating vendor and product data from transactional order data allows for independent scaling and data modeling. For example, this service's database can be optimized for read-heavy product browsing using read replicas and caching, a different pattern from the write-heavy order service.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Serves as the single source of truth for all product and vendor information.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Clear ownership of the vendor and product domain for a dedicated team.
- Can be scaled independently to handle high traffic from browsing customers.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- CRUD for Vendor Profiles, Products, Categories.
- Real-time inventory management.
- Vendor business hours and availability logic.
- Bulk CSV import/export of catalog.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Order processing or payment logic.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Support for product variations and options.
- Integration with vendor's external POS/ERP systems (explicitly out of scope for V1 per REQ-1-005).

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Validate product data (e.g., price > 0).
