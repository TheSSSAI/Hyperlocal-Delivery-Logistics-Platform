# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility for all vendor and product catalog data, including profiles, business hours, licenses, categories, products, and inventory.
- Secondary responsibility for providing real-time inventory data to the Order Management service and consuming order cancellation events to maintain stock accuracy.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (TypeScript) for the application framework, leveraging its modular architecture for organizing bounded contexts like 'Vendor Profile' and 'Product Catalog'.
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for the primary transactional database, serving as the source of truth for all vendor and product entities.
- Redis for a high-performance caching layer to offload the database for read-heavy operations, such as fetching product lists and vendor profiles.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a stateless, horizontally scalable microservice within an Amazon EKS cluster to meet scalability NFRs (REQ-1-100).
- Must expose a secure, role-based API for the Vendor Web Dashboard via the central API Gateway and internal APIs for other microservices via the service mesh.
- Performance is critical for read operations (product listings) and the synchronous inventory check endpoint, mandating an aggressive caching strategy and optimized database queries.

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a core functional requirement that defines the primary purpose of the repository: managing the product catalog and inventory.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-068

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

The vendor dashboard shall include a catalog management module. This module must allow vendors to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their product categories and individual products.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires full CRUD API endpoints for both 'Product' and 'ProductCategory' entities.
- NestJS DTOs with 'class-validator' annotations must be used to validate all incoming create/update requests.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- ProductModule
- ProductCategoryModule
- ProductController
- ProductCategoryController

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement elaborates on REQ-1-006, explicitly demanding full CRUD capabilities for both products and their organizational structure (categories).

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-055

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must perform a final, real-time inventory check for all items in the customer's cart at the exact moment they initiate payment.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a highly available and low-latency internal API endpoint that can check a batch of items.
- The database logic must use transactional locking (e.g., 'SELECT ... FOR UPDATE') to prevent race conditions.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- InventoryModule
- InventoryService
- InternalInventoryController

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical, synchronous dependency from the Order service that directly impacts revenue and requires a high-performance, transactionally safe implementation.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

P95 server-side latency for critical APIs must be under 200ms (REQ-1-093).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Mandates the use of a caching layer (Redis) for all high-volume read endpoints (e.g., fetching product lists). Database queries must be heavily optimized with appropriate indexes.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- A comprehensive caching strategy with clear invalidation logic is required.
- Database schema must be designed for efficient read performance.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Authorization shall be managed via a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, with permission checks enforced at both the API Gateway layer and within each individual microservice (REQ-1-096).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

Requires the implementation of NestJS Guards on all controllers. These guards must validate the incoming JWT and perform ownership checks to ensure a vendor can only modify their own resources.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- All endpoints must be protected by a default authentication guard.
- Services must include logic to check 'vendorId' from the JWT against the resource being accessed.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Given the multi-tenant nature of the service (managing data for many vendors), strict data isolation enforced by RBAC is a critical security requirement to prevent data leakage.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is responsible for implementing the complete lifecycle of vendor and product data. Functional requirements are centered around CRUD operations, inventory management, and bulk data handling. Non-functional requirements, particularly performance and security, are significant drivers of the architecture, necessitating a Redis cache and robust, vendor-scoped authorization logic.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service is modeled as the 'Vendor & Catalog' Bounded Context. Entities like 'VendorProfile' and 'Product' act as Aggregate Roots, with their own repositories and business logic encapsulated within NestJS services.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- VendorModule
- ProductModule

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Each bounded context is implemented as a NestJS module. Services within these modules will contain the business logic, and TypeORM repositories will handle persistence for the aggregates.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern aligns with REQ-1-104 and ensures a logical, maintainable separation of concerns that maps directly to the business domain.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Cache-Aside

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Used for all read-heavy operations, such as fetching a vendor's product catalog. The application service will first check Redis for the data; on a cache miss, it will query PostgreSQL, populate the cache, and then return the result.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- RedisModule
- ProductService
- VendorService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement a caching service or use NestJS's built-in 'CacheModule'. Update operations (create, update, delete) must include logic to invalidate the relevant cache keys to prevent stale data.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential to meet the stringent sub-200ms latency NFR (REQ-1-093) for a service with a high-read, moderate-write workload.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous Request/Response (REST or gRPC).

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Expose an endpoint like 'POST /internal/products/check-availability'.
- The endpoint must accept a list of product IDs and quantities and return a boolean availability status.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This integration is required for the critical pre-payment inventory check (REQ-1-055), which must be synchronous to guarantee order integrity.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Asynchronous Event Listener

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- platform-api-order-management

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous Pub/Sub via SNS/SQS.

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Must consume an 'OrderCancelledEvent' with a defined JSON schema containing 'orderId' and 'lineItems: [{productId, quantity}]'.
- Requires a dedicated NestJS provider decorated as an SQS message consumer.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This integration decouples inventory management from the order service, allowing for resilient stock updates on order cancellations as specified in the repository's dependency map.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

HTTPS/REST

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

All public-facing APIs for the Vendor Dashboard will be exposed as RESTful endpoints using NestJS controllers, secured by JWT authentication. OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation will be auto-generated.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the standard protocol for client-server communication, well-supported by web frameworks and providing a clear, stateless contract for the frontend.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

AWS SQS/SNS

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

The service will have a dedicated SQS queue subscribed to the central 'order-events' SNS topic. A NestJS provider will be implemented to poll this queue and handle incoming 'OrderCancelledEvent' messages.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This asynchronous, event-driven protocol provides resilience and loose coupling between the Order and Vendor Catalog services, as required by the system architecture (REQ-1-105).

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The synchronous, real-time inventory check API is a critical dependency for the entire platform's checkout flow. Any performance degradation or failure in this endpoint will directly block all sales.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

This endpoint must be architected for extreme high availability and low latency. The database transaction must be minimized, and the service must have dedicated monitoring, alerting, and aggressive autoscaling rules.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A failure in this single point of interaction has a cascading failure effect on the platform's core revenue-generating function.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Data Consistency

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The logic for updating inventory must be perfectly atomic. A race condition where two customers buy the last item simultaneously could lead to overselling, resulting in a failed order, a negative customer experience, and operational overhead.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The inventory update logic must use pessimistic row-level locking ('SELECT FOR UPDATE') within a database transaction. This must be thoroughly tested under concurrent load.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Maintaining accurate inventory is fundamental to the platform's reliability. Failure to do so undermines both customer and vendor trust.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided documents. The repository's scope was defined by its description and cross-referenced with functional requirements (REQ-1-006, REQ-1-068). The technology stack was validated against architectural requirements (REQ-1-007, REQ-1-104). Database schema analysis was based on the 'Vendor & Catalog Service DB Diagram'. Integration patterns were derived from the architecture document (REQ-1-105) and the repository's dependency map.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Mandate Redis caching for all product/vendor read APIs. Reason: To meet the sub-200ms latency NFR (REQ-1-093) given the high-read workload.
- Decision: Require asynchronous processing for bulk CSV operations. Reason: To prevent long-running requests from blocking the API server and to ensure scalability.
- Decision: Specify transactional row-level locking for the inventory check endpoint. Reason: To mitigate the critical risk of overselling race conditions.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: The term 'inventory management' implies transactional safety. Verified: This is a critical business need to prevent financial loss and is supported by findings related to race conditions.
- Assumption: 'High-read workload' necessitates caching. Verified: This is directly supported by the performance NFRs (REQ-1-093).

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the database schema ('Vendor & Catalog Service ER Diagram') contains all necessary tables and fields to support the functional requirements (e.g., 'VendorLicense' table for REQ-1-025, 'stock_quantity' in 'Product' table for REQ-1-006).
- Verified that the architectural pattern of asynchronous communication (REQ-1-105) is reflected in the repository's dependency on the Order service for cancellation events.
