# 3 Description

This microservice repository is responsible for user identity, authentication, authorization, and profile management for all user types (Customer, Vendor, Rider, Admin). It handles user registration, OTP-based login, and the issuance of JWTs. It integrates with AWS Cognito to offload core identity provider functionality. This repository's scope is strictly limited to managing who the users are and what they are allowed to access. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new granular libraries for contracts and observability.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The repository already represents a well-defined bounded context (Identity & Access) as per DDD principles. Its scope is clear and it has minimal business logic overlap with other services. Its internal structure is improved by consuming the new, focused shared libraries.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Serves as the central authentication and authorization point for the entire platform.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Isolates security-critical code into a single, hardened service.
- Can be developed and maintained by a team specializing in security and identity.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- User registration for all roles.
- OTP-based login.
- JWT issuance and refresh.
- User profile management (name, email, etc.).
- DPDP consent management (REQ-1-021).
