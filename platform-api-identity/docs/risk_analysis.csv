"RISK-001","Technical","A failure or high latency in a critical third-party API (Razorpay, Mapbox) could halt core business functions like payment processing or delivery logistics, leading to immediate revenue loss and severe customer dissatisfaction.","4","5","20","High","WI-014 (Checkout Saga Orchestrator), EPIC-005 (Payments & Settlements), EPIC-007 (Rider Logistics), CUS-025 (Customer Completes Online Payment), RDR-017 (Rider Uses In-App Navigation to Customer)","Heavy reliance on external services for core functionalities without direct control over their uptime or performance, as specified in REQ-1-090.","Implement robust resilience patterns for all third-party integrations as per REQ-1-028. This includes implementing circuit breakers, request timeouts with exponential backoff, and caching for non-transactional data (e.g., geocoding results). Pin all API versions as per REQ-1-091.","Develop runbooks for each critical third-party service outage. For payment gateway failure, the plan should involve disabling online payments and enabling COD-only mode. For mapping service failure, disable new order acceptance in affected zones.","Prometheus alerts are triggered when the error rate for a specific third-party API call exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window, or P95 latency exceeds 1500ms.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure in the distributed transaction (Saga pattern) for order checkout could lead to data inconsistency across microservices (e.g., payment taken but order not created), resulting in financial discrepancies, failed orders, and a poor customer experience.","3","5","15","High","WI-014 (Develop Checkout Saga Orchestrator), EPIC-004 (Order Management Service), EPIC-005 (Payments & Settlements Service)","The inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across distributed systems as mandated by the microservices architecture (REQ-1-104) and the Saga pattern (REQ-1-105).","Implement comprehensive integration tests for the Saga, covering all failure paths and compensating transactions. Utilize the Transactional Outbox pattern to ensure atomicity between database writes and event publishing. Ensure all Saga steps are idempotent.","Establish a 'dead-letter queue' for failed Saga events. Develop an admin tool or runbook for manually reconciling orders that are in an inconsistent state, using the distributed trace ID (correlationId) to investigate.","An alert is triggered if an order remains in an intermediate Saga state (e.g., 'payment_pending') for more than 10 minutes. A separate alert triggers for any failed compensating transaction.","Lead Engineer (Order Service)","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","The rider allocation algorithm fails to find a suitable rider for an order (e.g., due to low rider density or mass rejections), leading to the order being stranded, which causes extreme customer and vendor dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss.","4","4","16","High","REQ-1-078 (Rider Allocation Algorithm), REQ-1-079 (Re-assignment Logic), SYS-003 (System Flags Orders with Allocation Failure)","Marketplace imbalance where demand outstrips rider supply in a specific time or location. The algorithm may not be sufficiently sophisticated to handle edge cases or batching opportunities.","Implement the full re-assignment logic as per REQ-1-079. Develop a secondary 'broadcast' allocation model as a fallback if the primary targeted assignment fails. Implement surge pricing logic to incentivize more riders to come online during peak demand.","The system must automatically flag the order as 'Allocation Failed' and trigger a high-priority alert to the admin dashboard for manual intervention (ADM-020), such as calling a rider directly or cancelling the order and notifying the customer.","An alert is triggered when the percentage of 'Allocation Failed' orders exceeds 2% of total orders in any given hour for an operational zone.","Lead Engineer (Rider Logistics Service)","2024-10-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Security","A security vulnerability in the OTP login flow, JWT handling, or RBAC implementation could lead to unauthorized account access, enabling fraud, data theft, and violation of data privacy laws like the DPDP Act.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-008 (Implement OTP Login), WI-009 (Implement RBAC), EPIC-002 (Identity & Access Service), REQ-1-096 (AWS Cognito Usage)","Complexity of implementing a custom authentication flow and enforcing consistent authorization checks across a distributed microservice architecture.","Implement all security measures specified in REQ-1-041 (rate limiting, account lockout). Store refresh tokens in secure client-side storage (Keychain/Keystore). Enforce JWT validation at both the API Gateway and within each microservice. Mandate a third-party penetration test before public launch as per REQ-1-098.","Develop an incident response plan that includes a mechanism to globally invalidate all JWTs and force re-login for all users. Implement an immutable audit trail (REQ-1-013) to trace any unauthorized actions.","Alerts are configured for an unusually high rate of failed login attempts from a single IP or for a single account. Monitor audit logs for suspicious administrative actions.","Security Lead / Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The development team lacks sufficient expertise in the complex, specified technology stack (EKS, Terraform, Istio/App Mesh, NestJS Sagas), leading to implementation delays, poor architectural decisions, and lower code quality.","3","4","12","Medium","All development and infrastructure work items, particularly WI-002 (EKS), WI-006 (CD Workflow), and WI-014 (Checkout Saga).","Project requirements mandate a highly sophisticated, cloud-native architecture that may exceed the current skill set of the available development team.","Conduct a formal skills gap analysis for the team. Provide targeted training sessions and allocate budget for certifications. Enforce pair programming for complex modules. Hire at least one senior DevOps engineer with proven EKS and Terraform experience.","Retain a contract with a specialized cloud-native consultancy that can be engaged on short notice to resolve critical architectural blockers or perform targeted code reviews.","Monitor pull request cycle time and the volume of comments related to architectural patterns. An increase in 'time to merge' for infrastructure or core service PRs is an early warning.","Engineering Manager / Project Manager","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The high complexity of the end-to-end user flows across a three-sided marketplace makes E2E testing difficult to implement and maintain, leading to undetected bugs in critical paths like order placement or payout calculation.","4","4","16","High","All user stories, particularly cross-functional ones like CUS-025 (Payment), RDR-012 (Task Acceptance), and SYS-006 (Rider Settlement).","The system architecture involves four separate client applications and multiple backend microservices, creating a combinatorial explosion of test cases and states.","Invest dedicated resources into a Test Automation team. Build a robust test data generation framework. Utilize contract testing (e.g., Pact) to validate inter-service communication independently, reducing the reliance on full E2E tests for every scenario.","Allocate additional time for manual QA cycles before each release. Implement a feature flagging system to allow for phased rollouts of new features to a small subset of users, limiting the blast radius of any undiscovered bugs.","The ratio of bugs found in production versus bugs found in pre-production testing increases. The percentage of releases requiring a hotfix exceeds 10%.","QA Lead / Head of Engineering","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","Delays in the foundational Infrastructure and DevOps work (EPIC-001) will cause a cascading delay across all application development epics, as no services can be deployed or tested in a realistic environment, jeopardizing the entire project timeline.","3","5","15","High","All epics (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, etc.) are directly blocked by EPIC-001.","The project plan has a critical path dependency on the completion of the cloud infrastructure, EKS cluster setup, and CI/CD pipelines before application development can be effectively integrated and deployed.","Prioritize and fully resource EPIC-001 from day one. Have application developers use local development environments with Docker Compose to parallelize work, but with a clear plan for early and frequent integration into the real staging environment.","If the EKS setup is significantly delayed, create a temporary, simplified deployment environment using a more basic service (e.g., AWS Fargate or Elastic Beanstalk) for initial integration testing, with a clear plan to migrate to EKS later.","Any slippage in the delivery dates for key infrastructure work items (WI-001, WI-002, WI-006) beyond one week from the planned date.","Project Manager / DevOps Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Operational","The performance requirements (P95 < 200ms) are not met under real-world load, leading to a slow and unresponsive user experience, cart abandonment, and failed deliveries, ultimately making the platform non-viable.","3","5","15","High","REQ-1-093 (Performance Targets), REQ-1-100 (Scalability), all user-facing API endpoints.","Potentially inefficient database queries, unoptimized service logic, or network latency between microservices under high concurrent user load.","Integrate performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline. Conduct regular load tests against the staging environment simulating 10,000 concurrent users. Implement caching with Redis for read-heavy, non-volatile data. Utilize PostgreSQL read replicas.","Develop a performance tuning runbook. Allocate a 'performance budget' for each sprint to address bottlenecks as they are discovered. Be prepared to vertically or horizontally scale infrastructure resources if necessary.","The P95 latency for any critical API, as monitored by Prometheus, exceeds 200ms for more than 5 minutes outside of a deployment window.","Performance Engineering Lead / Head of Engineering","2024-10-30","Not Started"
