## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-039

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall provide a login mechanism for all registered users based on their mobile number. Upon entering their mobile number, the system shall send a One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS, which the user must enter correctly to be authenticated.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that an OTP is received on the registered mobile device.
- Enter the correct OTP and verify that the user is successfully logged in.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must implement an API endpoint to generate and send an OTP via a third-party SMS service (AWS SNS).
- The service must implement an API endpoint to verify a submitted OTP against a temporarily stored value (e.g., in Redis).
- Upon successful verification, the service must initiate a session by generating JWTs.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core functional requirement defining the primary authentication method for the Identity service.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-096

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall use AWS Cognito for user authentication and identity management. The authentication strategy must use short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens. Authorization shall be managed via a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, with permission checks enforced at both the API Gateway layer and within each individual microservice.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that user pools are configured in AWS Cognito.
- Confirm that API Gateway authorizers are configured to validate JWTs issued by Cognito.
- Attempt to access a vendor-only API endpoint using a customer's JWT and verify the request is denied with a 403 Forbidden status.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The service will integrate with the AWS Cognito SDK to create and manage user identities.
- The service is responsible for generating JWTs via Cognito after a successful custom authentication flow (OTP).
- The service must implement RBAC logic (e.g., using NestJS Guards) to protect its own endpoints based on roles defined in the JWT.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core technical requirement that dictates the authentication and authorization technology stack and patterns for this service.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-041

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall implement security measures for the OTP login process. Rate limiting must be applied to OTP generation requests for a single mobile number. If a user enters an invalid OTP, a clear error message must be shown. After 5 consecutive failed OTP entry attempts for an account, the account shall be temporarily locked from further login attempts for a configurable period.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Request OTPs for the same number multiple times in quick succession and verify that subsequent requests are blocked by rate limiting.
- Enter incorrect OTPs 5 times in a row. On the 6th attempt, verify that the login is blocked and a message about the temporary lock is shown.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must use a stateful store like Redis to implement rate limiting for OTP generation.
- The service must use Redis to track the count of consecutive failed OTP attempts per user.
- The service must implement logic to set a temporary lock on a user's account, preventing both OTP generation and validation during the lockout period.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines critical security features for the authentication flow that must be implemented by the Identity service.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-035

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system shall provide a registration flow for new Customers using a mobile number as the primary identifier. The mobile number must be validated to ensure it conforms to Indian mobile number standards (e.g., 10 digits, valid starting digit). Account ownership must be verified by sending a One-Time Password (OTP) to the provided number, which the user must enter correctly to complete registration.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Attempt to register with an invalid Indian mobile number format (e.g., 9 digits) and verify an error is shown.
- Enter a valid mobile number and verify an OTP is received via SMS.
- Enter the correct OTP and verify the customer account is created.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must provide API endpoints for a two-step registration process: requesting an OTP and verifying the OTP to create the account.
- The service must enforce unique constraints on mobile numbers across all user types.
- Upon successful registration, the service must publish a 'UserRegisteredEvent' to notify other parts of the system.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines the core user acquisition and onboarding functionality, which is a primary responsibility of the Identity service. Similar requirements REQ-1-036 and REQ-1-037 apply for Vendor and Rider registration.

### 1.2.5.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.5.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-021

#### 1.2.5.2 Requirement Text

The system shall comply with India's DPDP Act, 2023. During user onboarding, the system must present users with clear, granular consent options for the collection and processing of their personal data. The system must also provide a mechanism for users to view and manage their given consents after registration.

#### 1.2.5.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that a clear consent form is displayed before account creation.
- Verify that a logged-in user has a section in their profile to review and change their consent settings.

#### 1.2.5.4 Implementation Implications

- The service's database schema must include a 'UserConsent' table to store user preferences.
- The registration API must be updated to accept consent parameters.
- The service must expose API endpoints for users to GET and PUT their consent settings.

#### 1.2.5.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a critical legal and functional requirement for user data management, which falls squarely within the Identity service's domain.

### 1.2.6.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.6.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-023

#### 1.2.6.2 Requirement Text

The system shall implement a 'right to erasure' function that, upon a user's request, anonymizes their PII in all associated records. Personal data (name, address, contact info) in historical orders and transactions must be replaced with generic, non-identifiable placeholders. Non-personal transactional data (item details, amounts, timestamps) must be preserved for financial auditing.

#### 1.2.6.3 Validation Criteria

- Trigger the erasure process for a test user with historical orders.
- Verify that the user's account is deactivated and their profile PII is deleted.
- Inspect the historical order records for that user and confirm that fields like customer name and delivery address have been replaced with placeholders.

#### 1.2.6.4 Implementation Implications

- The Identity service must provide an API for users to request erasure.
- The service must implement logic to anonymize PII within its own database tables (User, CustomerProfile, Address).
- The service must publish a 'UserErasureRequested' event to a message bus to orchestrate the anonymization of PII in other services (like Order Management).

#### 1.2.6.5 Extraction Reasoning

This defines a key user lifecycle and data privacy function that is owned by the Identity service.

### 1.2.7.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.7.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-013

#### 1.2.7.2 Requirement Text

The system shall implement a dedicated, immutable audit trail to log all data modification actions performed by users with the 'Administrator' role. Each log entry must record the administrator who performed the action, the action taken, the data that was changed, and a timestamp.

#### 1.2.7.3 Validation Criteria

- Perform a data-modifying action as an Administrator (e.g., suspend a user).
- Verify that a corresponding entry is created in the audit log with the correct details.

#### 1.2.7.4 Implementation Implications

- The service's database schema includes an 'AuditLog' table as per the ER diagram.
- All API endpoints that perform administrative actions (e.g., user suspension, role changes) must include logic to write to this audit log table transactionally.

#### 1.2.7.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement mandates audit logging for administrative actions, many of which (user management) are implemented within this service.
