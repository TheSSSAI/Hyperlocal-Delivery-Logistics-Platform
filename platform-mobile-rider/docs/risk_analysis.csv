"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Saga pattern implementation for order creation could lead to critical data inconsistencies across microservices, such as a payment being captured but the order failing to be created in the Order Management service, resulting in financial loss and customer dissatisfaction.","4","5","20","High","Order Placement and Cart Management (REQ-1-003), Payment Processing (REQ-1-054), Saga Pattern Implementation (REQ-1-105)","High complexity of implementing distributed transactions correctly, especially regarding compensating transactions for rollback scenarios in a microservices architecture.","Conduct a technical spike/proof-of-concept for the Saga orchestration logic before full implementation. Enforce mandatory, rigorous peer reviews for all Saga-related code. Utilize a well-documented Saga library if available for the framework.","Develop idempotent reconciliation jobs that run periodically to detect and correct inconsistent states. For example, a job that cross-references captured payments with created orders and flags discrepancies for manual intervention.","Alert triggered if a Saga instance remains in an 'in-progress' state for more than a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 minutes). Dashboard monitoring the count of failed vs. successful Sagas.","Architecture Lead","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","A prolonged outage or significant API degradation of the primary payment gateway (Razorpay) would halt all online payment processing, directly stopping platform revenue and severely impacting customer trust and ability to transact.","3","5","15","High","Payment Processing (REQ-1-054), Razorpay Integration (REQ-1-090), Resilience Patterns (REQ-1-028)","Single point of failure for the critical revenue collection function due to heavy reliance on a single third-party provider.","Implement robust resilience patterns as per REQ-1-028, including circuit breakers that trip on high failure rates, and a fallback mechanism to temporarily disable online payments and only allow COD (if feasible) during an outage, with clear messaging to users.","Maintain a pre-vetted, standby integration with a secondary payment gateway provider. Develop a runbook detailing the procedure and estimated time to switch providers in a catastrophic failure scenario.","Prometheus alert when the 5xx error rate from the payment gateway's API exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window. Circuit breaker state change to 'Open'.","Backend Lead","2025-01-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Failure to meet the stringent P95 latency targets (<200ms for APIs, <3s for login) under the specified load (10k concurrent users) could lead to a poor user experience, resulting in high cart abandonment, rider frustration, and damage to the platform's brand.","4","4","16","High","Performance Targets (REQ-1-093), Scalability (REQ-1-100), Search Functionality (REQ-1-048)","The combination of a distributed microservices architecture, complex database queries (especially geospatial), and external API calls makes achieving consistently low latency a significant engineering challenge.","Integrate performance testing (e.g., k6, JMeter) early and continuously in the CI/CD pipeline. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed, non-volatile data. Optimize critical database queries and ensure proper indexing.","If performance targets are not met pre-launch, identify non-critical, high-latency features that can be temporarily disabled or simplified. Prepare a plan for vertical/horizontal scaling of specific microservices and database read replicas.","Automated performance tests in the CI pipeline fail. P95 latency alerts from Prometheus in the staging environment exceed the defined thresholds during load tests.","SRE/DevOps Lead","2024-12-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The complexity of end-to-end testing across a three-sided marketplace (Customer App, Rider App, Vendor Dashboard) with real-time features like chat and tracking may lead to insufficient test coverage, allowing critical bugs to reach production that disrupt the core order lifecycle.","4","4","16","High","Live Delivery Tracking (REQ-1-059), In-app Chat (REQ-1-081), Order Lifecycle Management (REQ-1-077)","Difficulty in automating and coordinating tests across multiple, distinct client applications and backend services, especially for asynchronous and real-time workflows.","Invest in a robust E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress for web, Appium/Detox for mobile) with a dedicated test environment. Create a comprehensive E2E test plan covering the full order lifecycle from placement to rating. Allocate specific sprint capacity for writing and maintaining these tests.","If automation proves too slow, establish a structured manual E2E testing plan to be executed before every release. Create a 'happy path' smoke test suite that can be run quickly to validate core functionality.","Key E2E test scenarios consistently fail in the CI/CD pipeline. A high rate of bugs related to cross-platform interactions is reported from staging.","QA Lead","2025-01-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","A misconfiguration in the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or Cluster Autoscaler on EKS could lead to services failing to scale under load, causing cascading failures, or scaling excessively, leading to significant, unexpected cloud infrastructure costs.","3","4","12","Medium","Kubernetes Deployment (REQ-1-018), Scalability (REQ-1-100)","Complexity of tuning autoscaling parameters (CPU/memory thresholds, node group configurations) to be both cost-effective and responsive to traffic spikes.","Conduct rigorous load testing in a production-like staging environment to fine-tune HPA and Cluster Autoscaler settings. Implement non-production cost monitoring and budget alerts in AWS.","Develop a runbook for manually scaling deployments and node groups in an emergency. Configure vertical pod autoscaling as a potential alternative if HPA proves difficult to tune for certain workloads.","Prometheus alerts for high pod restart counts, CrashLoopBackOff status, or sustained high CPU/memory utilization without a corresponding increase in pod count. AWS budget alerts being triggered.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The real-time rider location tracking feature, which relies on WebSockets, could suffer from high latency or connection instability on mobile networks, leading to a poor customer experience with a 'laggy' or 'frozen' map, undermining a key feature of the platform.","4","3","12","Medium","Live Delivery Tracking (REQ-1-059), Real-time Location Latency (REQ-1-061)","Inherent unreliability of mobile networks and the complexity of managing persistent WebSocket connections and reconnections on mobile clients (iOS/Android).","Implement robust client-side logic for automatic WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff. Design the UI to gracefully handle stale data by displaying the rider's 'last known location' with a timestamp if updates are missed (as specified in CUS-029). Optimize payload size for location updates.","If WebSockets prove too unreliable, develop a fallback mechanism where the client polls for location updates via a standard REST API, albeit at a lower frequency.","High rate of WebSocket disconnect events logged from the backend. Customer support tickets reporting that the tracking map is frequently 'frozen'.","Mobile Development Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","A skill gap within the development team regarding key technologies like PostGIS for geospatial queries or Terraform for Infrastructure as Code could lead to suboptimal implementation, causing performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or significant delays in foundational epics.","3","4","12","Medium","Technology Stack (REQ-1-111), Geofencing Tool (ADM-013), EKS Deployment (IA-008)","Adoption of a modern, but specialized, technology stack without ensuring the team has the requisite expertise or has allocated time for training.","Conduct an upfront skills assessment. Allocate budget and time for targeted training or workshops on PostGIS and Terraform.

Key infrastructure tasks are repeatedly pushed back across sprints.","Engineering Manager","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","Delays in foundational stories, such as User Registration (CUS-001) or the core CI/CD pipeline setup (WS-002), could have a cascading effect, blocking a large number of dependent features and jeopardizing the entire project timeline and pilot launch date.","4","4","16","High","Entire project, especially VND-002, CUS-003, and all deployment-related tasks.","High degree of dependency in the project plan, where multiple feature tracks are blocked by a small number of critical, foundational tasks.","Prioritize and allocate the most experienced developers to these foundational stories. Break down these epics into the smallest possible deliverables to enable parallel work on dependent stories using mocked APIs. Track progress on these critical path items daily.","If delays occur, immediately re-scope the initial pilot launch (REQ-1-112) to a more limited feature set that can be delivered on time. Communicate potential delays to stakeholders early.","Critical path tasks are not completed within their estimated sprint. Velocity charts show a consistent downward trend in early sprints.","Project Manager","2024-12-01","In Progress"
"RISK-009","External","The core business assumption of a sufficient population of all three user types (Customers, Vendors, Riders) within the pilot zone (REQ-1-001 assumption) may be incorrect, leading to a non-viable marketplace, low order volume, and project failure regardless of technical success.","2","5","10","Medium","Phased Rollout (REQ-1-112), and overall project viability.","Potentially inadequate market research or overestimation of user adoption rates in the target geographical area.","The business/marketing team must conduct pre-launch sign-up campaigns for vendors and riders to gauge interest. Run hyper-local marketing campaigns targeted at customers in the pilot zone immediately before and during launch.","If adoption is low, have a plan to pivot the pilot to a different geographical zone or offer significant incentives to onboard the initial cohort of users. The platform should be built to easily configure new operational zones.","Pre-launch sign-up numbers for vendors and riders are significantly below target. Early post-launch metrics show a severe imbalance in the user-type ratio (e.g., many vendors but few customers).","Product Owner","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Technical","The 'Right to Erasure' feature (REQ-1-023), which requires anonymizing PII across multiple microservices, could be implemented incompletely, leaving sensitive user data in some tables, logs, or backups.

Implement the anonymization process as an asynchronous, event-driven Saga. Conduct a thorough manual and automated QA process specifically for this feature, verifying data in all relevant databases and services.","If the automated process is found to be unreliable, a semi-automated runbook should be created for a data engineer to manually execute and verify the anonymization scripts on a per-request basis until the automated process is fixed.","An internal data audit or a user complaint reveals that PII remains after an erasure request has been processed. Automated tests for the anonymization Saga fail.","Data Protection Officer / Backend Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
