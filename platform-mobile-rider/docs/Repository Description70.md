# 3 Description

This repository contains the React Native source code for the rider-facing mobile application. Its core responsibility is to be the primary tool for delivery riders, enabling them to set their availability, receive and accept delivery tasks, navigate to pickup and drop-off locations using integrated maps, update order statuses, and track their earnings. This application requires deep integration with device hardware like GPS for continuous background location tracking and the camera for proof-of-delivery. Its dependencies have been updated to consume the new, granular shared libraries, streamlining its development and ensuring consistency.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The repository's focus as the dedicated rider application is maintained. The internal architecture is improved by offloading shared UI and API logic to the newly created shared libraries, allowing the rider app team to focus on the unique challenges of their domain, such as background location services, battery optimization, and offline capabilities.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Shared UI components are now consumed from REPO-UI-COMPONENTS.
- API data fetching logic is now handled by REPO-API-CLIENT.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a top-level application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Focused development on rider-specific workflows and hardware integrations.
- Reduced codebase complexity.
