## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Offline Support

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-087: Implement basic offline support to view locally cached data like order history and profile information.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Requires a client-side persistence strategy (e.g., Redux Persist with AsyncStorage/MMKV). API-calling services must be designed to handle network failures gracefully and queue critical actions (like status updates) for later synchronization.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- State management must account for 'pending sync' states.
- A background service or listener for network status changes is required.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical NFR for a mobile app used in environments with potentially unstable network connectivity. User stories RDR-016, RDR-018, and RDR-022 explicitly call for this behavior.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-061: End-to-end latency for real-time location updates must be under 2 seconds.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The background location service must be optimized for frequent, low-latency data transmission. This influences the choice of data format (e.g., Protocol Buffers vs. JSON) and transport protocol. The client-side logic must also be performant to not add significant delay.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- GPS sampling frequency must be balanced with battery consumption.
- Payloads sent to the backend must be minimal (lat, long, timestamp, accuracy).

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR directly constrains the implementation of the app's most resource-intensive feature: background location tracking.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-040: Issue short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens. Refresh tokens must be securely stored.

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

The application must use native secure storage (Keychain for iOS, Keystore/EncryptedSharedPreferences for Android) to store the refresh token. The API client must include an interceptor to automatically handle token expiry and use the refresh token to get a new access token.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- Do not store tokens in AsyncStorage or other non-secure local storage.
- Refresh token logic must be robust to handle network failures during the refresh attempt.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a standard, critical security requirement for modern mobile applications to maintain persistent but secure user sessions.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The Rider App's requirements focus heavily on a robust, real-time, and resilient user experience. The core functionality is defined by the delivery workflow state machine (accept, arrive, pickup, deliver), which must function reliably even with intermittent network connectivity. NFRs for performance and offline support are the primary architectural drivers.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) variant

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The UI is built with React components (View). Custom React Hooks ('useTask', 'useAuth') act as the ViewModel, containing presentation logic, managing component state, and delegating business operations to services. The Model is represented by data from backend services.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- React Components (Views)
- Custom Hooks (ViewModels)
- Services (Model interaction)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Each feature screen (e.g., TaskDetails) will be paired with a custom hook (e.g., 'useTaskDetails') that provides all the data and action handlers needed by the view. This decouples the view from the underlying service and state management logic.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is native to the React ecosystem, promotes separation of concerns, and enhances testability. It aligns perfectly with the 'Hook-First API Exposure' principle from the repository guidelines.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Flux/Unidirectional Data Flow

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Global application state (e.g., authentication status, rider availability, active task ID) is managed in a centralized Redux or Zustand store. UI components and hooks dispatch actions to trigger state changes, and subscribe to state updates to re-render.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- Redux/Zustand Store
- Slices/Reducers
- Actions/Thunks

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) or Zustand to define state 'slices' for each major domain (e.g., 'authSlice', 'taskSlice'). Asynchronous operations like login or fetching tasks will be handled by 'createAsyncThunk' or equivalent middleware.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The technology stack explicitly lists Redux/Zustand. This pattern provides predictable state management, which is crucial for a complex application with real-time updates and background processes.

### 4.1.3.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.3.1.0 Pattern Name

Offline Queue

#### 4.1.3.2.0 Pattern Application

For critical, state-changing actions performed while offline (e.g., updating delivery status), the request is serialized and saved to a persistent queue on the device (e.g., in MMKV or AsyncStorage). A background process monitors network connectivity and syncs the queue when online.

#### 4.1.3.3.0 Required Components

- NetworkInfoService
- RequestQueueService
- PersistentStorage

#### 4.1.3.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Wrap the core API client. If a request fails due to a network error, the wrapper serializes the request (endpoint, payload, method) and adds it to the queue. A listener for network status changes will trigger the queue processor.

#### 4.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

REQ-1-087 and multiple user stories mandate offline capability. A persistent queue is a standard pattern to ensure data is not lost and actions are eventually consistent.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

- Manage connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect with exponential backoff).

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Required for in-app chat (REQ-1-081) and efficient real-time updates, as specified in REQ-1-092.

### 4.2.3.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.3.1.0 Integration Type

Push Notifications

#### 4.2.3.2.0 Target Components

- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

#### 4.2.3.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous (Push).

#### 4.2.3.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Integrate the React Native Firebase library.
- Implement logic to request permissions, register the device token with the backend, and handle incoming notifications in foreground, background, and terminated states.

#### 4.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

FCM is mandated by REQ-1-090 and is essential for alerting riders of new task offers when the app is not in the foreground (RDR-010).

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Implementation Complexity

### 7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The requirement for reliable background location tracking on Android is a significant technical challenge. Different OEM modifications to the Android OS aggressively kill background services to save battery, which can disrupt the app's core functionality. The implementation will require a robust foreground service and potentially native Android code.

### 7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

Requires allocation of a senior developer with specific experience in Android native modules and background services. The testing plan must include a wide range of physical Android devices from different manufacturers (Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, etc.).

### 7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to implement this correctly will lead to unreliable tracking, failed ETAs for customers, and a poor rider experience, undermining a core value proposition of the platform.

## 7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Dependency

### 7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The application's architecture is entirely dependent on the 'REPO-API-CLIENT' for all backend interactions. Any breaking changes, bugs, or performance issues in this shared library will directly and critically impact the Rider App.

### 7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

A strict versioning and testing strategy for the 'REPO-API-CLIENT' is mandatory. The Rider App team must be involved in the review and testing process for any changes to this client library.

### 7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This tight coupling to a single library represents a potential single point of failure and a development bottleneck if not managed with a rigorous process.

## 7.3.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

User Experience

### 7.3.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The offline support requirement (REQ-1-087) is broad. The user stories specify queuing for status updates, but the full extent of offline capabilities needs to be precisely defined to avoid scope creep and manage user expectations. For example, can a rider accept a task while offline? Can they view navigation?

### 7.3.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

The product and engineering teams must define a clear 'Offline Support Matrix' detailing what features are available and how they behave without a network connection. This will directly influence the complexity of the client-side persistence and synchronization logic.

### 7.3.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.3.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

An unclear offline strategy can lead to a confusing user experience and significant implementation overhead. Defining the boundaries is crucial for sprint planning.

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

This analysis was conducted by systematically processing all provided cached context artifacts. Requirements (JSON) and User Stories were used to define the functional scope. The Architecture document defined the overall system structure and client's role. Database ERDs provided context for the data models the app will consume. Sequence diagrams detailed the specific interaction patterns to be implemented. UI Mockups informed the component structure and user flow.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Adopt an MVVM-like architecture using custom Hooks as ViewModels. Reason: Aligns with modern React patterns and the repository guidelines, promoting testability and separation of concerns.
- Decision: Prioritize the implementation of a robust offline request queue. Reason: Mandated by NFRs and multiple user stories, and critical for reliability in the target market.
- Decision: Emphasize the need for specialized expertise in Android background services. Reason: Identified as the highest technical risk in the repository analysis.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: The 'REPO-API-CLIENT' will provide a stable, well-documented, and performant interface. This was validated against its defined role in the architecture_map.
