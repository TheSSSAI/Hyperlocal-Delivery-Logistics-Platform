# This file configures NPM to use a private registry, such as AWS CodeArtifact.
# Replace placeholders with your actual registry information.
# Example for AWS CodeArtifact:
# @hyperlocal:registry=https://your-domain-123456789012.d.codeartifact.your-region.amazonaws.com/npm/your-repo/
# //your-domain-123456789012.d.codeartifact.your-region.amazonaws.com/npm/your-repo/:always-auth=true

# For local development, this can be left commented out.
# The CI/CD pipeline will configure this dynamically using secrets.
