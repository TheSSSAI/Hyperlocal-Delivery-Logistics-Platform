"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","The complexity of the Saga and Transactional Outbox patterns (TASK-005) is high and relies solely on the Senior Backend Developer's expertise.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-005"",""TASK-006"",""TASK-007""]","4","Mandate pair programming between the senior and mid-level developers for this task. Allocate extra time for architectural review with the Tech Lead.","If implementation proves too complex, revert to a simpler, less resilient synchronous API call pattern as a temporary measure and log the technical debt.","The task exceeds its estimated time by more than 30%.","","Within Sprint 2"
