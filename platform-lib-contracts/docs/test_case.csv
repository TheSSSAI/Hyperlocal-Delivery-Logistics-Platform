"TEST-OMS-001","Order Placement","Functional","System/E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end success of a customer placing a prepaid order, including inventory check, payment processing, state transitions, and notifications.","Critical - This is the primary revenue-generating workflow. Failure directly impacts revenue and customer trust.","High","Customer logged in; Vendor is 'Online'; Product has stock > 0; All services (Order, Payment, Catalog, Notification) are running in the Staging environment.","1. Customer adds item to cart. 2. Customer proceeds to checkout and selects 'UPI'. 3. System performs inventory check. 4. Customer is redirected to mock payment gateway. 5. Customer authorizes payment. 6. Verify customer is redirected to 'Order Placed' screen. 7. Verify order status becomes 'Pending Vendor Acceptance'. 8. Verify vendor receives a new order notification.","Order is successfully created with status 'Pending Vendor Acceptance', payment is processed, inventory is decremented, and all parties are notified.

"TEST-FIN-001","Financial Calculations","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the correctness of the commission calculation logic for an order with a vendor-specific, category-specific, and default commission rate.","Critical - Incorrect calculations lead to direct financial loss or partner disputes, undermining the business model.","Medium","Payments & Settlements service is running with a test database. A completed order exists. Vendor, Category, and Default commission rates are pre-configured.","1. Trigger the commission calculation service for an order from a vendor with a specific rate (10%). 2. Verify calculated commission is correct. 3. Trigger calculation for an order from a vendor with only a category rate (12%). 4. Verify calculation is correct. 5. Trigger calculation for a vendor with no overrides. 6. Verify the default rate (15%) is used.","The correct commission amount is calculated and stored in the immutable financial ledger, strictly following the hierarchy: Vendor > Category > Default.","Test vendors with different commission setups.
