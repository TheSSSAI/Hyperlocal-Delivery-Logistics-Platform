# 2 Name

platform-lib-contracts

# 3 Description

This is a new, decomposed, cross-cutting library that serves as the single source of truth for data contracts across the entire distributed system. It contains all TypeScript interfaces, classes, and enums for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), event payloads for the SNS/SQS message bus, and public API models. Extracted from the original monolithic 'platform-shared-libs' repository, its sole responsibility is to define the shape of data exchanged between microservices and between the frontend and backend. This strict separation ensures type safety, decouples services from each other's internal implementations, and allows services to be compiled and validated against a stable, versioned contract, which is critical for maintaining architectural integrity in an event-driven microservices environment.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-LIB-SHRD

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Extracted to create a stable, independently versioned set of data contracts. This prevents the entire ecosystem from needing a rebuild when unrelated shared logic changes. It enforces a clear boundary between services, where the only coupling is the data contract itself, enabling true independent development and deployment.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Data Transfer Object (DTO) definitions
- Event payload schemas for asynchronous communication
- API model interfaces

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Consumed by all backend microservices to ensure consistent event and API structures.
- Consumed by 'platform-api-client' to provide typed interfaces for frontend applications.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables compile-time safety for inter-service communication.
- Allows teams to evolve services independently as long as they adhere to the published contract version.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Type definitions for all API DTOs.
- Type definitions for all SNS/SQS event payloads.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any business logic or runtime code.
- Any third-party dependencies.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- New versions of contracts are introduced for breaking changes.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- All properties must be explicitly typed.
