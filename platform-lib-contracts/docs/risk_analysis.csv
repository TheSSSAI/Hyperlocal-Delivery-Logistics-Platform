"RISK-001","Technical","The Saga pattern for distributed transactions (e.g., order creation) is complex. A failure in a step without a correctly executed compensating transaction could lead to data inconsistency, such as charging a customer for an order that is never created or holding inventory for a failed payment.","3","5","15","High","Order Placement (CUS-025), Payment Processing (REQ-1-003), Saga Pattern Implementation (REQ-1-105)","Inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across multiple, decoupled microservices in the event of partial failures.","Implement a Transactional Outbox pattern to ensure atomicity between database state changes and event publishing. Develop a dedicated 'Saga Reconciliation Service' to handle and flag failed Sagas from a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual intervention.","In case of a failed Saga, an alert is sent to the on-call engineering team for manual database correction based on payment and order logs. Proactive customer support outreach is initiated for affected users.","A non-zero number of messages in the Order Creation Saga's Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). A discrepancy is detected between payment gateway transaction logs and the number of 'Pending Vendor Acceptance' orders.","Backend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","Critical functionalities like payment processing (Razorpay), mapping/logistics (Mapbox), and notifications (FCM/SNS) depend on external APIs. An outage, significant latency increase, or breaking API change from these providers could halt core business operations.","3","5","15","High","Payment Processing (CUS-025), Live Delivery Tracking (CUS-028), Rider Navigation (RDR-014, RDR-017), All notification-related stories (e.g., CUS-030)","Dependency on third-party services for core system functionality, which are outside the project team's control.","Implement and test robust Circuit Breaker patterns for all critical external API calls (REQ-1-028). Implement contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline to detect breaking API changes early (REQ-1-091). Design and document fallback mechanisms (e.g., temporarily disabling online payments and only allowing COD).","An 'External API Outage' runbook will be executed by the operations team. This includes posting status updates for users, pausing affected features, and preparing for manual reconciliation of any transactions that were in-flight during the outage.","Prometheus alert fires for a high rate (>5%) of 5xx errors or timeouts on API calls to Razorpay or Mapbox. A circuit breaker trips to the 'Open' state.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The project has a highly dependent feature structure where foundational stories (e.g., User Registration, Admin Approval) block entire workstreams. A delay in any single story on the critical path will cause a cascading domino effect, delaying all subsequent features and jeopardizing the launch date.","4","4","16","High","The entire project plan, especially downstream features like Order Placement, Delivery Execution, and Financial Settlements which depend on core user and order entities.","Tightly coupled dependencies between user stories and functional modules required for a Minimum Viable Product.","Aggressively prioritize and resource all stories on the critical path. Use feature flagging to decouple deployments from feature releases, allowing dependent teams to build against mocked interfaces if a prerequisite is delayed. Conduct weekly critical path reviews.","A 'Minimum Viable Path' of features for a soft launch will be pre-defined. If delays occur, a revised, phased rollout plan will be presented to stakeholders to launch with a reduced, but still functional, feature set.","Any story on the critical path is not in a 'Done' state by the end of its planned sprint. The project burndown chart shows a consistent deviation from the ideal line for more than one week.","Project Manager","2025-02-28","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Quality","A bug in the financial module's logic for calculating commissions (REQ-1-033), vendor payouts (REQ-1-083), or rider earnings (REQ-1-084) could lead to systemic under/overpayments, causing direct financial loss to the company or destroying trust with partners.","2","5","10","Medium","Financial Module implementation (REQ-1-082), Vendor Payouts (SYS-007), Rider Settlements (SYS-006)","Complexity in financial calculations, including edge cases like partial refunds, custom commission rates, and reconciliation of COD amounts.","Mandate 100% test coverage for all financial calculation logic using Test-Driven Development (TDD). Implement the double-entry accounting ledger as specified in REQ-1-082. Create an independent daily reconciliation script that audits the ledger and flags discrepancies.","If the reconciliation script detects an error, all automated payouts are halted. A manual financial audit is initiated. A pre-approved budget is available for correcting payment errors and providing goodwill compensation to affected partners.","The daily financial reconciliation script reports a balance mismatch greater than â‚¹0.01. An increase in support tickets from vendors/riders regarding payment discrepancies above the baseline.","Backend Lead (Financials)","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project relies on a complex, modern technology stack (EKS, Terraform, Service Mesh, Saga Pattern). A lack of deep expertise within the team in any of these areas could lead to poor architectural decisions, security vulnerabilities, deployment bottlenecks, and significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","Infrastructure setup (EPIC-002), CI/CD Pipeline (WS-003), Saga Implementation (WS-002), Observability Setup (EPIC-003)","High skill ceiling required for the selected technologies, which may not be uniformly present across the entire team.","Conduct a formal skills assessment. Allocate budget for an external DevOps consultant for initial setup and periodic reviews. Mandate peer reviews of all Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) and complex backend logic by the most senior engineer. Invest in targeted training and certification.","Maintain a support contract with AWS Enterprise Support for rapid assistance with EKS-related issues. Have a simplified, non-service-mesh deployment configuration available as an emergency fallback.","Key infrastructure or architectural tasks (e.g., 'Set up CI/CD pipeline') are delayed by more than one sprint. High rate of pod restarts or unexplained 503 errors between services in the staging environment.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-01","In Progress"
"RISK-006","Technical","The real-time live tracking feature (CUS-028) requires continuous GPS data from the rider's app, which can cause significant battery drain and lead to rider dissatisfaction and churn. GPS inaccuracy in dense urban environments can also result in a poor customer experience.","4","3","12","Medium","Live Delivery Tracking (CUS-028, CUS-029), Rider location updates.","Physical limitations of mobile device batteries and GPS hardware in challenging environments.","Implement adaptive location polling in the rider app (e.g., higher frequency when moving, lower frequency when stationary). Use a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular triangulation (fused location provider). Provide clear guidance to riders on battery optimization settings for their devices.","If battery drain remains a major issue post-launch, develop a 'Battery Saver' mode for riders that switches to lower-frequency, milestone-only updates (e.g., sends location only at pickup and arrival).","The number of support tickets from riders complaining about battery drain exceeds 5 per week. Analytics show a high percentage of riders force-closing the app mid-delivery.","Mobile Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
