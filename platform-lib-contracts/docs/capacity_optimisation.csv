"Load Balancing","Sprint 1 has high utilization (83%) while Sprint 2 is very low (28%).","Move non-dependent, lower-priority tasks from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2. Specifically, TASK-018, TASK-019, and TASK-023 could be deferred.","Reduces risk in Sprint 1 and provides a more consistent team velocity. Sprint 1 utilization drops to ~60%, Sprint 2 increases to ~50%.","2","Immediate (during planning)","More balanced sprint plans with utilization between 60-80% for both sprints.","Reduced risk of burnout and delays in critical Sprint 1 tasks."
"Cross-training","Single point of failure on DevOps expertise.","Allocate 4 hours in Sprint 1 for the DevOps Engineer to pair with the Senior Backend Developer on the GitHub Actions workflow (TASK-016).","Creates a backup resource for CI/CD pipeline maintenance and troubleshooting, reducing key-person dependency by 50%.","8","Sprint 1","The Senior Backend Developer can independently debug and modify a basic pipeline workflow.","Mitigates risk of project-wide delays if the primary DevOps resource is unavailable."
