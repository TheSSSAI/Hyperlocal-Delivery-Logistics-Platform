## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-105

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

Communication between microservices shall primarily be asynchronous using a message bus (AWS SQS/SNS) to ensure decoupling and resilience. For distributed transactions that span multiple services (e.g., order creation), the Saga pattern must be implemented to manage data consistency. Synchronous, direct API calls are permissible only for user-facing operations requiring an immediate response.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that after initial placement, subsequent steps like notifying the vendor are handled via asynchronous messages.
- Inspect the implementation of the order creation process and confirm it follows the Saga pattern to coordinate state changes across the Order, Payment, and Vendor services.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This library must define the TypeScript interfaces for all event payloads that will be serialized and sent over the AWS SQS/SNS message bus.
- The contracts for Saga pattern events (e.g., OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed, OrderFailed) must be explicitly defined here to ensure consistency between participating microservices.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is critically relevant as this library's primary purpose is to define the data contracts (event payloads) for the asynchronous communication mandated by the architecture.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-092

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall enforce secure and standardized communication protocols. All client-server communication must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Real-time features like live tracking and chat must use the Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol. The data interchange format for all APIs must be JSON. All public-facing APIs must be versioned in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/).

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Use a network analysis tool to confirm that all API traffic is encrypted over HTTPS.
- Inspect API responses and confirm they are in valid JSON format.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- This library must define the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) as TypeScript interfaces or classes that represent the structure of the JSON payloads for all API requests and responses.
- Standardized error response contracts (e.g., IApiErrorResponse) should be defined here to ensure consistency across all microservice APIs.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement mandates a standardized JSON data interchange format. This library is the designated single source of truth for defining the structure of that JSON, making it directly responsible for fulfilling the standardization aspect of the requirement.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'N/A - Contract Library', 'component_specification': 'This repository does not contain executable components. Its sole purpose is to define TypeScript data contracts (interfaces, classes, enums) that are consumed by components in other microservice repositories. It is a compile-time dependency, not a runtime component.', 'implementation_requirements': ['The library must not contain any business logic, functions, or methods with implementations.', 'The library must not have any runtime dependencies (i.e., it should only contain type definitions).'], 'architectural_context': 'This library is a foundational, cross-cutting concern that underpins the entire distributed system, enabling type-safe communication between all other components.', 'extraction_reasoning': 'It is critical to establish that this repository is architecturally distinct from service repositories and has a non-executable, definitional role. This prevents the introduction of business logic or runtime dependencies, preserving its purpose.'}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Cross-Cutting Concerns', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Represents functionalities applicable across multiple microservices, typically implemented as shared libraries. Manages concerns like data contracts, shared utilities, and standardized logging.', 'layer_constraints': ['Components in this layer must be highly stable and have minimal dependencies to avoid causing cascading changes across the system.', 'Libraries in this layer should not contain service-specific business logic.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Shared Library', 'Data Contracts'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository is explicitly mapped to the 'cross-cutting' layer. Its function as a shared library of data contracts for all services is a perfect fit for this layer's responsibilities."}

#### 1.6.1.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.6.1.4 Service Level Requirements

- Contracts must be versioned. Breaking changes require a new major version of the library.
- Contracts must be backward-compatible within a major version.

#### 1.6.1.5 Implementation Constraints

- All event payloads must extend a base interface that includes metadata like eventId, timestamp, and correlationId.

#### 1.6.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

This represents the family of event contracts this library exposes for asynchronous communication, which is a core requirement (REQ-1-105). It defines the shape of data on the message bus.

IDataTransferObject

- platform-api-orders
- platform-api-vendor-catalog

#### 1.6.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.6.2.4 Service Level Requirements

- DTOs for public APIs must remain stable. Changes require a new API version.
- DTOs must not expose internal database structures.

#### 1.6.2.5 Implementation Constraints

- DTOs used in API requests must include validation decorators (e.g., from class-validator) to be used by frameworks like NestJS for automatic request validation.

#### 1.6.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

This represents the family of DTO contracts for synchronous API communication, a core requirement for standardization (REQ-1-092). It defines the shape of JSON data for all RESTful services.

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The library must be written in pure TypeScript. It should not depend on any specific runtime framework like NestJS or React, as it is a pure declaration library.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- TypeScript

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

N/A - This is a compile-time library with no runtime performance characteristics.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

Contracts must be designed to avoid defining fields for sensitive data in plaintext (e.g., passwords, full credit card numbers).
