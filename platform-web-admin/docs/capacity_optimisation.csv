"Resource Utilization","Frontend and QA resources have extremely low planned utilization (<15%), indicating significant idle capacity and high cost per task.","Expand the project scope to include development of the Vendor and Admin web dashboards in parallel, or re-allocate these resources to other projects.","Increase resource utilization to a sustainable 60-80%, maximizing ROI on staffing costs.","","Immediate (Sprint 2 onwards)","Average sprint utilization for Frontend/QA resources exceeds 60%.","Avoids thousands in salary costs for idle resources."
"Mentoring & Knowledge Transfer","Senior Backend Developer has zero allocated tasks in Sprints 2 and 4, creating an opportunity for skill development.","Formally schedule paired programming sessions between the Senior and Mid-level backend developers during Sprint 2 to design and prototype the complex Saga pattern.","Reduces the 'Saga complexity' risk (RISK-001), upskills the mid-level developer, and improves knowledge redundancy.","","Sprint 2","Mid-level developer can independently contribute to the Saga implementation in Sprint 3.","Mitigates key-person dependency and reduces risk of costly architectural mistakes."
