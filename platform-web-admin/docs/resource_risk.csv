"RISK-003","Timeline / Resource","The provisioning of the AWS EKS cluster via Terraform is complex and on the critical path. The single DevOps engineer is a bottleneck, and any delays will cascade to all subsequent development.","Medium","High","[""US-002-T-001"",""US-002-T-002"",""US-002-T-003"",""US-005-T-001""]","2","Augment team with a part-time DevOps contractor for the first 4 weeks to parallelize infra work.","Develop against local Docker Compose environment to unblock backend API development.","EKS cluster is not provisioned and accessible by the end of Sprint 2.","16000","4 weeks"
"RISK-001","Technical / Skill","The checkout Saga pattern is highly complex. Failure in logic could lead to critical data inconsistency (e.g., charging customers without creating orders).","Medium","High","[""US-010-T-001"",""US-010-T-002"",""US-010-T-003""]","1.5","Allocate senior backend developer (backend.dev2) to lead and mentor. Implement a design spike and rigorous, failure-path-focused integration testing.","Develop an admin dashboard for manual saga recovery and alerting for failed transactions.","High rate of messages in the saga's dead-letter queue.","","Within Sprint 3"
"RISK-006","Quality / Resource","Low number of planned QA hours (12.32h over 8 weeks) is insufficient for building a robust E2E test suite for a complex multi-client system, leading to high risk of production bugs.","High","Medium","[""ALL""]","","Re-allocate QA engineer's significant buffer capacity to proactively build an automated E2E test suite from Sprint 1 onwards.","Schedule manual 'bug bash' sessions before each major release, involving the whole team.","Number of automated E2E tests is not growing proportionally with new features.","","Ongoing"
