"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify account lockout mechanism is triggered after 5 consecutive failed OTP login attempts.","High - Prevents brute-force attacks on user accounts and mitigates financial risk from SMS spam.","Medium","A registered user exists. The authentication service is running. Redis is accessible.","1. Request an OTP for the user. 2. In a loop, submit an incorrect OTP 5 times to the verification endpoint. 3. After the 5th failed attempt, verify the API response indicates an account lockout. 4. Immediately attempt to request a new OTP and verify the request is blocked. 5. Wait for the lockout period to expire. 6. Request a new OTP and verify it is sent successfully.","The account is locked after the 5th failed attempt. No further OTP requests or validations are allowed for the configured duration. The account is automatically unlocked after the period expires.","A valid, registered user's mobile number. A test harness to intercept and read generated OTPs.","Jest, Supertest, Redis client","3","6","1","Authentication Service, Redis","Integration environment","API returns 429 or 403 error on the 6th attempt. Lockout is confirmed in Redis. Account is usable after lockout period.","Critical - Security vulnerability allowing brute-force attacks.","Every release","Low","Clear user's lockout key in Redis.","This is a primary security test. The lockout duration and attempt count must be configurable.","The check must add <20ms to the API response time.","N/A"
"TEST-SAGA-001","Order Placement","Functional","System","Critical","true","High","Verify the Checkout Saga's compensating transaction for a failed payment refund.","Critical - Failure to refund after a failed order creation leads to financial loss and loss of customer trust.","High","All microservices (Order, Payment, Vendor) are running. Customer has a valid cart.","1. Mock the Vendor service's inventory check to fail after the Payment service has successfully processed a payment. 2. Initiate the checkout process via API for a customer. 3. Verify the Saga starts and the Payment service 'captures' the payment. 4. Verify the Saga proceeds and the Vendor service returns an 'inventory unavailable' error. 5. Verify the Saga orchestrator receives the failure event and triggers a compensating transaction. 6. Verify the Payment service receives a 'refund' command and executes it.","The final order status is 'Cancelled'. A refund transaction is logged in the Payment service. The customer is not charged. The Saga completes in a compensated state.","Customer account with a valid cart. Mock services for Payment and Vendor services.","Cypress (to trigger), Jest/Supertest, Pact (for service mocks)","8","24","8","Order Service, Payment Service, Vendor Service, Message Bus (SQS/SNS)","Staging environment with service mocking capabilities","100% test pass rate.

"TEST-E2E-001","End-to-End Order Flow","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","Very High","Verify the complete end-to-end happy path: customer places order, vendor accepts, rider picks up and delivers.","Critical - This validates the core business functionality of the entire platform.","High","A clean staging environment with seeded data for a customer, vendor, and rider.","1. (Customer App) Login. 2. Search for a vendor. 3. Add an item to the cart. 4. Proceed to checkout and complete payment. 5. (Vendor Dashboard) Login and verify new order appears. 6. Accept the order and mark it 'Ready for Pickup'. 7. (Rider App) Login, go online, and accept the task. 8. Navigate to the vendor, mark 'Picked Up'. 9. Navigate to the customer, mark 'Delivered' using POD. 10. (Customer App) Verify order status is 'Delivered'.","The order successfully transitions through all states. All three users see the correct UI updates in their respective applications. Financial transactions are correctly logged.","Seeded data for one customer, one vendor with products, one rider, and one admin. Razorpay sandbox credentials.","Cypress (Web), Appium/Detox (Mobile), Test Data Seeding Scripts","12","40","16","All microservices and client applications.","A fully integrated staging environment","The entire flow completes without errors. Order status is 'Delivered'.","Critical - Core business function is broken.","Every release, and nightly on staging.","High","Reset all user states; cancel the order if it fails mid-flow.","Test credentials should not be hardcoded in scripts.","The entire flow should be completable within a reasonable time frame.","N/A"
"TEST-PERF-001","Live Order Tracking","Performance","System","High","true","High","Measure the end-to-end latency of rider location updates from rider app transmission to customer app display.","Medium - High latency degrades the core 'live tracking' user experience and reduces customer trust.","High","Performance testing environment is provisioned. WebSocket service is under load.","1. Simulate 1000 concurrent riders sending location updates every 5 seconds. 2. Simulate 1000 concurrent customers connected to the WebSocket service. 3. In a controlled test script, send a single location update with a unique timestamp from a simulated rider. 4. In a simulated customer client, record the time when that specific update is received. 5. Calculate the latency. 6. Repeat for 1000 data points and calculate the 95th percentile.","The P95 end-to-end latency is under 2 seconds, as per REQ-1-061.","N/A - Data is generated by the load test script.","k6, JMeter, or a custom WebSocket load testing script.
