"RISK-001","Technical","The checkout process relies on a complex Saga pattern for distributed transactions across Order, Payment, and Vendor services. A failure in the saga logic or compensating transactions could lead to critical data inconsistency, such as a customer being charged without an order being created or inventory not being released after a failed payment.","3","5","15","High","WI-009-CheckoutSaga (Implement Checkout Saga for Order Creation), CUS-025 (Customer Completes Online Payment)","Inherent complexity of managing state and ensuring data consistency across multiple, independently deployed microservices in a critical business transaction.","Implement the Saga using a well-vetted orchestration library. Enforce a transactional outbox pattern for atomic database updates and event publishing. Develop extensive integration tests covering all failure paths and their corresponding compensating transactions. Implement a dead-letter queue for failed saga events.","Develop an administrative dashboard for 'Saga Recovery' that allows operators to view failed transactions, manually inspect the state of each service involved, and trigger a retry or a manual compensation. Configure critical alerts for any saga entering a failed state.","Prometheus alert fires when the count of messages in the saga's dead-letter queue is greater than zero. A high rate of saga timeouts or compensation failures is detected.","Backend Lead","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The platform has critical dependencies on third-party APIs for core functionality: Razorpay for payments, Mapbox for rider allocation and tracking, and AWS SNS for OTP-based authentication. An outage, high latency, or breaking API change from any of these providers would severely degrade or completely halt essential services, directly impacting revenue and user trust.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-006-Auth (Login/Registration), WI-009-CheckoutSaga, WI-011-OrderTracking, REQ-1-008, REQ-1-028","Delegation of core business functions to external services, creating single points of failure outside the project's direct control.","Implement robust resilience patterns for all external API calls, including timeouts, retries with exponential backoff, and circuit breakers as specified in REQ-1-028. Pin all API integration versions to prevent unexpected breaking changes. Implement contract testing in the CI pipeline to detect provider API changes early.","For payment gateway failure, display a user-facing message 'Online payments are temporarily unavailable' and enable only Cash on Delivery. For mapping service failure, degrade functionality to disable live tracking and switch to a simpler allocation algorithm. Have documented runbooks for diagnosing and responding to each specific third-party outage.","A high rate (>5%) of 5xx errors or timeouts is detected for a specific third-party API endpoint, triggering a Prometheus alert. The circuit breaker for a critical external service trips to an 'open' state.","DevOps Lead","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The provisioning of the entire AWS infrastructure via Terraform, especially the AWS EKS cluster, is a complex, high-effort task on the critical path. Any delays in this foundational work will cause a cascading slip in the timeline for all backend service development and deployment, as no environment will be available for developers.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-001 (Platform Infrastructure and DevOps), WS-001-Infra, WI-002-EKS. This blocks all subsequent development epics.","High complexity and potential for unforeseen issues in setting up a production-grade Kubernetes environment and its networking from scratch using Infrastructure as Code.","Assign a dedicated, senior DevOps engineer with proven EKS and Terraform experience to lead this workstream. Utilize official, well-maintained Terraform modules for AWS components (VPC, EKS) to reduce custom code and leverage best practices. Start infrastructure work in Sprint 0 or 1.","Develop a simplified, temporary 'developer environment' using Docker Compose that developers can run locally to unblock API development while the full cloud environments are being provisioned. Maintain a version-controlled manual setup guide as a last-resort backup.","The EKS cluster is not provisioned and accessible by the end of the second sprint. Key Terraform modules (VPC, RDS) are not completed by the end of the first sprint.","Project Manager","2024-07-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","A bug in the automated Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline could deploy a faulty microservice to the production environment, potentially causing a major outage. The GitOps approach means a bad merge to the main branch could be automatically promoted, reducing the window for manual intervention.","4","4","16","High","WI-005-CD (Create CD Workflow for Backend Microservices), All deployment activities.","The complexity of the deployment workflow (Docker build, ECR push, Terraform apply) and the tight coupling between source control and the production environment.","Treat the CI/CD pipeline as production-critical code with its own reviews. Enforce a manual approval gate in the GitHub Actions workflow for all deployments to the Production environment. Implement robust pre-deployment smoke tests and automated canary or blue-green deployment strategies managed by Kubernetes.","Develop and document a rapid rollback procedure that involves reverting the commit and re-running the CD workflow. Ensure Terraform state is versioned and backed up. Maintain a runbook for manual deployment via `kubectl apply` as an emergency fallback.","Post-deployment monitoring shows a spike in API error rates or latency for the newly deployed service. Health checks for the new pods in Kubernetes start failing during a rolling update.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The real-time live tracking and chat features rely on a stateful WebSocket layer. This component is difficult to scale horizontally and can be a significant source of resource consumption (memory, CPU). A poorly designed implementation could lead to frequent disconnects for users, high battery drain on rider devices, and server instability under load.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-011-OrderTracking, CUS-028 (Customer Tracks Rider), REQ-1-015, REQ-1-081","The inherent complexity of managing thousands of persistent, stateful connections in a distributed system, especially for mobile clients with unreliable networks.","Use a scalable WebSocket adapter for NestJS that leverages a Redis backplane to broadcast messages across multiple service instances. Implement an efficient heartbeat mechanism to detect and clean up dead connections. Optimize client-side logic for connection retries with exponential backoff. Conduct rigorous load testing on the WebSocket service.","If the WebSocket service proves unstable, implement a fallback mechanism where the customer app polls for location updates via a standard REST API every 15-20 seconds. This degrades the user experience but maintains core functionality. Have a feature flag to disable live tracking during periods of high instability.","A high rate of WebSocket connection errors is detected. The number of active WebSocket connections on the server approaches the configured limit. Customer complaints about 'frozen' rider tracking increase.","Backend Lead","2024-10-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The complexity of the three-sided marketplace with four distinct client applications and multiple interacting microservices makes end-to-end (E2E) testing extremely challenging and time-consuming. Inadequate E2E testing could lead to critical bugs in production that were missed during isolated component testing, such as a vendor accepting an order but the rider never receiving the task.","4","4","16","High","All development epics. Affects overall product quality and stability.","High number of integration points and user flows across multiple, independently deployed components and user interfaces.","Invest in a dedicated E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress for web, Appium/Detox for mobile) from the beginning of the project. Define and automate a suite of 'critical path' tests (e.g., user registration, full order lifecycle, payout). Allocate dedicated sprint time for writing and maintaining these tests. Use a shared staging environment with seeded data for running tests.","Maintain a well-documented manual E2E test plan for all critical user flows. Schedule regular, manual 'bug bash' sessions involving the entire project team before each major release. Create a rapid hotfix process to quickly address critical bugs found in production.","The number of automated E2E tests is not growing in proportion to the number of new features. The rate of production bugs related to cross-service interactions increases.","QA Lead","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project's technology stack (EKS, Terraform, NestJS, Saga Pattern, PostGIS) is advanced and requires specialized expertise. A lack of senior-level experience in these specific areas could lead to suboptimal architectural decisions, implementation delays, and increased technical debt that will be costly to fix later.","3","4","12","Medium","All development and infrastructure epics, particularly WI-002-EKS, WI-009-CheckoutSaga.","Mismatch between the complexity of the chosen technology and the available skills within the development team.","Prioritize hiring or allocating senior engineers with proven experience in the key technologies. Mandate a rigorous code review process where all critical infrastructure and backend logic is reviewed by a senior team member. Invest in targeted training and create proof-of-concept spikes for complex patterns like the Saga before full implementation.","Engage an external consultant or firm specializing in AWS/Kubernetes or distributed systems for initial architecture review and to provide guidance. Simplify the architecture where possible (e.g., use a simpler orchestration method if the team cannot handle a Saga) even if it means deferring some scalability goals.","Key technical tasks are consistently taking longer than estimated. The number of architecture-related questions or blockers increases during daily stand-ups. Code quality metrics decline.","Engineering Manager","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Security","Failure to correctly implement the requirements of India's DPDP Act 2023, particularly the 'right to erasure' (REQ-1-023) and granular consent management (REQ-1-021), could lead to significant legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of user trust. Implementing these features correctly across a distributed microservices architecture is highly complex.","3","5","15","High","REQ-1-021, REQ-1-023, REQ-1-095 (Data Retention). Affects the Identity and Order Management services primarily.","The complexity of tracking and anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is spread across multiple databases and services, while preserving transactional integrity for auditing.","Engage legal counsel to provide a clear interpretation of the DPDP Act's technical requirements. Develop a 'Data Map' that documents where all PII is stored across the system. Implement the anonymization process using an asynchronous, event-driven Saga to ensure all services correctly process the erasure request. Conduct a dedicated security and compliance review of this feature.","If the automated erasure feature is delayed, implement a documented, manual process for handling user erasure requests that can be executed by a trusted administrator. This process must be auditable. Prioritize the consent management feature, as it is a prerequisite for legal data collection.","The 'Data Map' is not complete by the end of the initial design phase. The erasure Saga implementation is falling behind schedule. The number of user data privacy-related queries increases.","Chief Technology Officer (CTO)","2024-10-30","Not Started"
