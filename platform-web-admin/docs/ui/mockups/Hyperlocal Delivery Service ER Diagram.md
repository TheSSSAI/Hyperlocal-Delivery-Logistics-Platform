# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Order
- VendorProfile
- RiderProfile
- Product
- Payment
- DeliveryTask
- SupportTicket
- FinancialTransaction
- Payout

## 3.2 Key Processes

- User places an Order, which contains OrderItems.
- An Order generates a DeliveryTask, performed by a Rider.
- An Order generates FinancialTransactions, which lead to Payouts for Vendors and Riders.
- A VendorProfile sells Products, which are organized into ProductCategories.
- Users can write RatingReviews and create SupportTickets.

## 3.3 Decision Points

- This is an ERD and does not contain decision points in the traditional sense; relationships represent data structure rather than process flow.

## 3.4 Success Paths

- The diagram illustrates the data relationships required for a successful end-to-end order flow, from user registration to financial settlement.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- This is an ERD and does not explicitly model error states in data.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The schema supports one-to-many and one-to-one relationships, such as a user having multiple addresses or a delivery task having one proof of delivery.
