# 3 Description

This repository contains the React.js source code for the administrator-facing web dashboard. This is a powerful, internal tool that provides platform administrators with full oversight and control over the entire system. Its responsibilities include managing all user types (customers, vendors, riders), approving new vendor/rider registrations, configuring system-wide settings (like fees and operational zones), monitoring system health, managing support tickets, and viewing comprehensive reports. It is the central nervous system for platform operations. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new shared UI and API client libraries for consistency and efficiency.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

UNCHANGED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

self

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The repository's focused role as the central admin tool is maintained. Abstraction of common UI and API logic into shared libraries allows the admin dashboard team to focus on building complex and powerful internal tools, such as data visualizations, geofencing interfaces, and detailed auditing views, without being burdened by reinventing basic components.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Shared UI components are now consumed from REPO-UI-COMPONENTS.
- API data fetching logic is now handled by REPO-API-CLIENT.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- N/A - This is a top-level application.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Rapid development of internal tooling and management interfaces.
- Maintains a clear separation between internal admin tools and public-facing applications.
