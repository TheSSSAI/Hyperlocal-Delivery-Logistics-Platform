# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Consumer

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service is a pure consumer in an event-driven architecture. It subscribes to topics on the platform's message bus (SNS) via a dedicated SQS queue, processing business events asynchronously.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- SqsConsumerService
- NotificationOrchestratorService

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement an SQS message poller that fetches messages in batches. Each message is parsed and validated against a known event schema (DTO). A strategy or factory pattern within the orchestrator will delegate the event to a specific handler based on its type.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern, mandated by REQ-1-105, is essential for decoupling the notification logic from the business logic of other services, enhancing scalability and resilience.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Gateway / Adapter

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as a gateway to external notification providers. The 'FcmService' and 'SnsSmsService' are adapters that translate internal notification requests into the specific API calls required by Firebase and AWS SNS, respectively.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- FcmService
- SnsSmsService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Each service will encapsulate the provider-specific SDK, connection management, authentication, and error handling. They will expose a simple, standardized method (e.g., 'send(to, message)') to the rest of the application.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern isolates external dependencies, making it easy to swap out providers in the future (e.g., replace SNS with Twilio) with minimal changes to the core application logic.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Design Requirement

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service requires a robust and flexible notification templating engine. The current stateless design implies templates will be stored in config files, which may become difficult to manage as the number of notification types grows.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A decision is needed on the templating strategy. For V1, config files are acceptable. For V2, a simple database table or a dedicated template management service might be required for non-technical users to edit templates.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Managing dozens of templates in environment variables or config files is not scalable and is prone to error. A more structured approach should be considered for future iterations.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Dependency Management

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service is dependent on event contracts (schemas/DTOs) from multiple upstream services. Without a shared library or schema registry, the service is brittle and susceptible to breaking changes from producers.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A shared NPM package containing all platform-wide event DTOs must be created and used by this service and all event producers. This ensures type safety and contract consistency.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical architectural pattern for a stable event-driven system. It prevents runtime errors and simplifies development and maintenance across the platform.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided requirements, user stories, and architectural specifications. Requirements like REQ-1-090 and REQ-1-073 directly shaped the core functionality. Architectural patterns from REQ-1-105 defined the integration method. NFRs like REQ-1-028 and REQ-1-097 dictated the resilience and security implementation.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to treat the service as stateless with no primary database, based on the repository description and architectural principles of single-responsibility services.
- Decision to manage notification templates via configuration files to align with the stateless principle for the initial version.
- Decision to model the internal structure around an 'Orchestrator' and provider-specific 'Clients' (FcmService, SnsSmsService) to follow the Gateway/Adapter pattern.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that upstream services will publish well-structured events with all necessary data was validated against user stories like CUS-030, which imply dynamic data (Vendor Name, Rider Name) will be available.
- Assumption that a centralized message bus (SNS/SQS) is a platform-wide standard was confirmed by REQ-1-105.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced REQ-1-090 (specific providers FCM/SNS) with REQ-INT-003 from the user stories, confirming technology alignment.
- Cross-referenced the 'stateless' repository description with the need for a templating mechanism, leading to the critical finding about template management strategy.
