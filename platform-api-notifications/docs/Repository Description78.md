# 3 Description

This is a lightweight, focused microservice with the single responsibility of sending all user-facing notifications. It listens to business events from across the platform (e.g., 'OrderAccepted', 'RiderAssigned', 'PayoutFailed') and translates them into the appropriate push notifications (via FCM) or SMS messages (via AWS SNS). By centralizing this functionality, we decouple all other services from the specific details of notification providers. This service is designed to be simple, stateless, and highly reliable. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new granular shared libraries.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This service follows the single responsibility principle perfectly. It acts as an anti-corruption layer for external notification systems. If the platform decides to switch from FCM to another push provider, only this single, small service needs to be changed, leaving all other business logic services untouched. It is a classic example of a focused, event-driven utility microservice.

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Sending push notifications to mobile clients.
- Sending transactional SMS (e.g., OTPs).

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any business logic that decides *when* a notification should be sent. It only decides *how* to send it.
