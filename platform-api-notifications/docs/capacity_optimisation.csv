"Knowledge Transfer","High key-person dependency on the senior developer for security, architecture, and DevOps.","Mandate pair programming sessions for all 'High' complexity tasks (WI-019, WI-006, WI-012, WI-013).","Upskill 2 mid-level developers, reducing key-person risk by 60% over 2 sprints and improving code quality.","24","4 weeks","Mid-level developers can independently explain and modify the complex logic after the sprints.","Avoids potential project delays worth an estimated $30,000 due to resource unavailability."
"Testing Strategy","Heavy reliance on E2E tests, which are brittle for a microservices architecture.","Introduce consumer-driven contract testing (Pact) for inter-service communication and Testcontainers for integration tests.","Faster and more reliable test feedback in CI/CD pipeline, reducing integration bugs by 40%.","16","2 weeks","CI build time reduced by 25%; fewer 'works on my machine' issues.","Saves approximately 80 developer-hours per quarter in debugging integration issues."
