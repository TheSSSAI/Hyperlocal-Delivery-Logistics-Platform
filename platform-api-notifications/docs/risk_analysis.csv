"RISK-001","Technical","Failure or incorrect implementation of the Saga pattern for distributed transactions (e.g., order creation) could lead to severe data inconsistency, such as a payment being captured without an order being created, resulting in financial loss and customer dissatisfaction.","3","5","15","High","Order Placement and Cart Management (CUS-025), Payment Processing, Order Cancellation (CUS-034, CUS-035), Financial Reconciliation.","The inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across multiple, independently deployed microservices (Orders, Payments, Vendor) without distributed transactions. The `workCatalog` also flags this as high complexity.","Adopt a well-documented Saga orchestration library. Implement robust, idempotent compensating transactions for every step of the saga. Mandate peer reviews specifically focused on the Saga logic. Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern (WI-005) to guarantee event emission upon successful DB commit.","Develop an automated reconciliation job that runs periodically to detect and flag inconsistent states. Create an operational runbook for manually correcting failed Sagas, with alerts sent to the on-call engineer via Alertmanager.","A Prometheus alert fires when the number of 'failed' or 'stuck' Sagas in the orchestration log exceeds a threshold of 1 in 5 minutes. A high number of messages in the SQS Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","An outage or significant performance degradation of a critical third-party API (Razorpay for payments, Mapbox for logistics) will directly halt core business functions, preventing new orders or crippling the delivery tracking experience, leading to immediate revenue loss and reputational damage.","3","5","15","High","Payment Processing (CUS-025), Payouts (SYS-006, SYS-007), Live Delivery Tracking (CUS-028), Rider Navigation (RDR-014, RDR-017), Address Management (CUS-007).","Heavy dependency on external, single-source-of-truth services for core functionality, as outlined in requirements REQ-1-008 and REQ-1-090.","Implement and thoroughly test resilience patterns as per REQ-1-028: Circuit Breakers to prevent cascading failures, exponential backoff for retries, and defined fallback mechanisms (e.g., temporarily disable online payments and display a user-friendly message).","Maintain a pre-vetted plan and lightweight integration code for a secondary payment gateway and mapping service. Establish a clear 'incident response' protocol to quickly switch to fallback modes or communicate downtime to users.","Prometheus alerts fire when the error rate for external API calls exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window or when the Circuit Breaker is tripped (open state).","DevOps Lead","2024-12-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Inadequate end-to-end (E2E) testing coverage for cross-service workflows, particularly the Saga-based order lifecycle, could allow critical bugs to reach production, causing data corruption, financial discrepancies, or a complete failure of the core user journey.","4","5","20","High","The entire order lifecycle from CUS-025 (Payment) to RDR-019 (Delivery), including cancellations (CUS-034, CUS-035) and financial settlements (SYS-006, SYS-007).","The difficulty of setting up and maintaining a stable E2E testing environment that accurately simulates the interaction between multiple microservices, databases, and message queues. The `workCatalog` highlights advanced testing needs (Testcontainers, Pact).","Mandate the use of Testcontainers (WI-008) for integration tests that require real databases. Implement Pact for contract testing between services to catch breaking API changes early. Develop a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress that runs against a dedicated, staging-like environment in the CI pipeline.","If automated E2E coverage is low before a release, increase the scope and duration of manual Quality Assurance (QA) regression testing. Implement feature flags to allow for a phased rollout of complex new features to a small subset of users.","Code coverage for integration tests drops below 70%. The E2E test suite in the CI pipeline fails to pass for more than 24 hours, blocking deployments.","QA Lead","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","A skill gap within the development team regarding critical, specialized technologies (Kubernetes, Terraform, PostGIS, Saga patterns, OpenTelemetry) could lead to suboptimal implementation, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All infrastructure tasks (WS-006), distributed transaction logic (WI-003, WI-005), observability setup (WI-011), and geospatial features (ADM-013).","The project's technology stack (REQ-1-111) is modern and complex, requiring expertise that may not be evenly distributed across the team.","Conduct a team skills matrix assessment to identify gaps. Provide targeted training and allocate budget for workshops. Enforce pair programming for all tasks involving these critical technologies. Hire a short-term consultant for initial architecture and setup review.","Allocate an additional 20% time buffer in the project plan for tasks identified as having a high skill dependency. Simplify initial implementation where possible (e.g., use Saga choreography instead of orchestration) if skill gaps cannot be filled.","Pull Request (PR) review cycles for tasks in critical areas consistently exceed 3 days, indicating uncertainty or knowledge gaps. Key infrastructure tasks are delayed by more than one sprint.","Engineering Manager","2024-11-01","In Progress"
"RISK-005","Technical","Failure to meet the stringent P95 latency requirements (e.g., <200ms for APIs, <2s for live tracking) under production load could result in a poor user experience, cart abandonment, and failure of real-time features, undermining the platform's value proposition.","3","4","12","Medium","Product Discovery (CUS-010), Search (CUS-011), Checkout (CUS-025), Live Tracking (CUS-028), and all API-driven interactions.","Complex data aggregation across microservices, inefficient database queries (especially geospatial), or bottlenecks in the real-time communication layer (WebSockets).","Incorporate performance testing with tools like K6 into the CI/CD pipeline. Proactively optimize all database queries and ensure proper indexing is in place. Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis for hot data) for read-heavy endpoints. Load test the WebSocket infrastructure early.","If performance targets are not met, provision oversized infrastructure (larger database instances, more EKS nodes) as a temporary solution. In parallel, dedicate a tiger team to performance profiling and optimization.","Grafana dashboards show P95 latency for critical APIs exceeding 150ms in the staging environment. Load tests fail to meet the target concurrency or latency goals.","Lead Performance Engineer","2025-01-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","A misconfiguration in the CI/CD pipeline or Terraform manifests could lead to failed deployments, deploying a broken artifact to production, or creating a security vulnerability (e.g., exposing a service publicly), causing significant downtime or a data breach.","3","4","12","Medium","All deployment and infrastructure management tasks (WS-006). This risk impacts the ability to release any new feature or bug fix.","Complexity of managing a GitOps-style, Infrastructure-as-Code pipeline for a containerized microservices application on Kubernetes.","Mandate a multi-environment promotion strategy (Dev -> Staging -> Prod). All infrastructure changes must be peer-reviewed. Implement automated `terraform plan` checks in Pull Requests. Use static analysis tools for Terraform (`tfsec`) and Dockerfiles (`hadolint`) in the CI pipeline.","Maintain a documented rollback procedure for every deployment. Ensure the ability to quickly revert to a previous stable version via the CI/CD pipeline. Conduct periodic 'game day' exercises to practice rollback procedures.","The CI/CD pipeline for the staging environment remains broken (red) for more than 4 hours. A deployment to production causes an immediate spike in the API error rate (>5%).","DevOps Lead","2024-11-10","In Progress"
"RISK-007","Quality","Incomplete or incorrect implementation of the 'right to erasure' functionality (REQ-1-023) as per the DPDP Act could lead to failure to fully anonymize user PII across all microservices, resulting in a compliance breach, significant legal fines, and reputational damage.","2","5","10","Medium","User data erasure (CUS-043), User deactivation (ADM-007), Data retention policy enforcement (REQ-1-095).","User data is distributed across multiple services (Identity, Orders, Ratings), making it difficult to ensure complete and consistent anonymization. PII might also be inadvertently stored in logs or other unexpected places.","Conduct a thorough data mapping exercise to identify all locations of PII. Use an event-driven approach (Saga) to orchestrate the anonymization process across all relevant services. Implement a dedicated E2E test that triggers erasure and then queries all services and logs to verify that no PII remains.","If a flaw is discovered post-launch, immediately disable the self-service erasure feature and create a manual, script-based process for handling requests while the automated flow is being fixed. Consult with legal counsel to manage any potential breach notification requirements.","A QA audit or a data privacy scan reveals that PII for an 'erased' user still exists in one of the system's data stores. The E2E erasure test fails in the CI pipeline.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-02-01","Not Started"
