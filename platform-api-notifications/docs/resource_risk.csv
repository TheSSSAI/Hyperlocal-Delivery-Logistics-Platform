"RISK-R001","Key Person Dependency","Heavy reliance on `senior.backend.dev1` for critical distributed systems patterns (Transactional Outbox, Saga). If unavailable, Sprint 1 goals are at risk.","Medium","High","[""TASK-OMS-011"",""TASK-OMS-006"",""TASK-OMS-013""]","3","Mandate pair programming between `senior.backend.dev1` and `senior.backend.dev2` on TASK-OMS-011. Require comprehensive documentation of the pattern.","Engage a pre-vetted external consultant specializing in distributed systems for NestJS.","Task `TASK-OMS-011` is delayed by more than 2 days.","25000","1 week to onboard consultant."
"RISK-R002","Single Point of Failure","The entire CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure setup depends on one DevOps Engineer. Their unavailability would block all deployments and environment setups.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-OMS-017"",""TASK-OMS-018"",""TASK-OMS-019"",""TASK-OMS-021"",""TASK-OMS-016""]","4","Prioritize thorough documentation of the CI/CD pipeline. Cross-train `senior.backend.dev2` on basic pipeline maintenance and Terraform apply procedures.","Retain a DevOps contracting firm on a low-cost retainer for emergency support.","Key DevOps tasks are not started within the first 3 days of the sprint.","10000","1-2 days to engage contractor."
"RISK-R003","Skill Gap","The QA Engineer is tasked with setting up a complex Testcontainers framework, which has a high learning curve. Delays will impact the quality validation of critical database logic.","Medium","Medium","[""TASK-OMS-010B""]","1","Allocate a 4-hour time-boxed spike at the start of the sprint for the QA engineer to create a PoC. Provide access to online courses or workshops.","If Testcontainers proves too difficult, fall back to using a shared PostgreSQL instance in the CI environment, accepting the risk of test flakiness.","The Testcontainers setup task is less than 50% complete by the mid-sprint checkpoint.","500","3 days to implement fallback."
