"RISK-001","Timeline","The project has a highly sequential critical path where foundational epics (Infrastructure, Identity) must be completed before core business logic (Orders, Logistics) can be built. Any delay in an early epic will create a cascading delay across the entire project, significantly jeopardizing the launch timeline.","4","5","20","High","All development epics (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005) are blocked by EPIC-001 (Identity) and EPIC-006 (Infrastructure).","Strong coupling of dependencies between foundational services and business-logic services in the initial project plan.","1. Prioritize and resource the Infrastructure (EPIC-006) and Identity (EPIC-001) epics with dedicated senior engineers. 2. Define API contracts (OpenAPI) and mock servers for dependent services early, allowing parallel development of consumer services against the mocks. 3. Implement weekly cross-team dependency reviews.","If delays occur, immediately re-prioritize the feature set to focus on a smaller, vertical slice of functionality for the MVP launch, potentially deferring features like bulk-import or complex reporting.","Any foundational work item (e.g., WI-006-1-2 EKS Cluster Terraform) slipping its estimated completion date by more than 2 days.","Project Manager","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The project's reliance on the Saga pattern for distributed transactions (e.g., order creation) introduces significant complexity. A flawed implementation could lead to data inconsistency, financial discrepancies, and partially processed orders that are difficult to debug and require manual intervention, eroding user trust.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-003 (Order Management), EPIC-005 (Payments & Settlements), specifically work items like WI-003-1-1 (Order Creation API).","The architectural choice of microservices necessitates complex patterns to maintain data consistency across service boundaries for core business transactions.","1. Mandate a formal architectural design review for all Sagas. 2. Develop a standardized, reusable Saga orchestration library or pattern. 3. Implement comprehensive distributed tracing and correlation IDs from day one to ensure full visibility into Saga execution.","Develop and deploy idempotent reconciliation jobs that run periodically to detect and correct data inconsistencies resulting from failed Sagas.","Alertmanager triggers an alert if the rate of failed or uncompensated Saga transactions exceeds 5 per hour.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","The platform's core functionality is critically dependent on third-party APIs: Razorpay for all payments and payouts, and Mapbox for all logistics (routing, geofencing). An outage, significant latency, or breaking API change from either provider would immediately halt revenue generation or delivery operations.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-003 (Order Management), EPIC-004 (Rider Logistics), EPIC-005 (Payments & Settlements).","Business decision to outsource non-core but critical functions (payments, mapping) to specialized third-party providers.","1. Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern for all critical third-party API calls. 2. Develop graceful degradation fallbacks (e.g., temporarily disable online payments, switch to less accurate routing). 3. Pin API versions and use contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline to detect breaking changes early.","Maintain a documented manual process for handling critical failures (e.g., manual refund processing, communicating with riders via phone). Establish an on-call rotation with a runbook for handling third-party outages.","Prometheus alert fires when the error rate for Razorpay or Mapbox API calls exceeds 10% over a 5-minute window.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The live rider tracking and chat features depend on a stateful WebSocket infrastructure. Scaling and ensuring the reliability of WebSocket connections, especially with flaky mobile networks, is significantly more complex than stateless REST APIs. Failure can lead to a poor user experience, loss of key features, and high support load.","4","4","16","High","WI-004-2-2 (Live Location Tracking), CUS-031, CUS-032, RDR-028 (Chat functionality).","The requirement for real-time, bidirectional communication for core user-facing features.","1. Use a managed WebSocket service or a robust framework with a Redis backplane to handle scalability. 2. Implement robust client-side logic for automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. 3. Design a heartbeat mechanism to proactively detect and clean up dead connections.","Develop a fallback mechanism where the customer app periodically polls a REST endpoint for location updates if the WebSocket connection is down for more than 60 seconds. Chat functionality would be temporarily unavailable.","Alert fires if the number of active WebSocket connections drops unexpectedly or if the Redis backplane message queue depth exceeds a threshold.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The operational complexity of managing a production-grade EKS cluster, including the service mesh (App Mesh), observability stack (Prometheus), and CI/CD integration, is high. Misconfigurations in networking, autoscaling, or security can lead to widespread service downtime, deployment failures, or security vulnerabilities.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-006 (Shared Infrastructure), all service deployments.","The choice of a powerful but complex container orchestration platform to meet scalability and resilience requirements.","1. Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for all EKS and related resource configurations, enforcing peer review for all changes. 2. Implement a GitOps approach (e.g., with ArgoCD or Flux) for Kubernetes deployments to ensure a declarative and auditable state. 3. Conduct regular disaster recovery drills, such as simulating node or AZ failures.","Maintain a comprehensive runbook for EKS recovery scenarios. Ensure RDS database backups are tested and point-in-time recovery procedures are documented and practiced.","Alertmanager alert on key EKS control plane metrics, high pod restart counts, or failed deployments in the CD pipeline.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project mandates advanced skills in EKS, Terraform, PostGIS, NestJS, and distributed systems patterns (Sagas, event-sourcing). A skill gap in the team or the loss of a key senior engineer could severely impact development velocity, implementation quality, and lead to significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All development epics, particularly EPIC-004 (Logistics/Geospatial), EPIC-003 (Order/Saga), and EPIC-006 (Infra/EKS).","The adoption of a modern, complex, but powerful technology stack to meet long-term business goals.","1. Conduct a team skills assessment and provide targeted training or hire to fill gaps. 2. Enforce pair programming on complex features to share knowledge. 3. Document all architectural decisions and complex implementations thoroughly in a centralized knowledge base (e.g., Confluence).","Have a budget pre-approved for engaging external consultants or contractors on short notice to backfill critical skill gaps if a key team member departs.","PR review comments consistently indicate a lack of understanding of core patterns. Velocity for complex stories (e.g., >8 points) consistently misses estimates.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","End-to-end testing of asynchronous, distributed workflows (e.g., order creation, rider allocation, payment reconciliation) is inherently difficult. A failure to invest in robust integration and E2E testing automation could lead to critical, multi-service bugs being discovered only in production, causing significant service disruption and reputational damage.","4","3","12","Medium","All cross-service user stories, e.g., CUS-025 (Payment), RDR-012 (Task Acceptance), VND-017 (Order Acceptance).","The complexity of replicating a full microservices environment and its dependencies for automated testing.","1. Implement contract testing (e.g., Pact) to verify interactions between services without needing to run the full stack. 2. Build a dedicated, stable E2E testing environment that is a close replica of production. 3. Develop test harnesses and data seeding scripts to create predictable states for E2E test scenarios.","Allocate dedicated QA engineer time for extensive manual regression testing before each release. Implement a phased rollout (canary release) strategy to limit the impact of any uncaught bugs.","A high rate of bugs being found during manual QA or in production that span multiple services, indicating a gap in automated integration testing.","QA Lead","2024-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","The requirements for DPDP Act compliance ('Right to Erasure', granular consent) are legally mandated. An incorrect interpretation or a flawed technical implementation (e.g., incomplete PII anonymization) could expose the company to significant legal penalties, fines, and reputational damage.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-001-3-2 (Consent Management), WI-001-3-3 (Right to Erasure).","External legal and regulatory compliance requirements imposed on the business.","1. Obtain a formal legal review and sign-off on the technical implementation plan for all DPDP-related features. 2. Conduct a thorough data discovery process to map all PII across all services and databases. 3. Perform a dedicated QA cycle focused on verifying the completeness of the data anonymization process.","In case of a compliance issue, have a documented incident response plan that includes legal counsel, a public relations strategy, and a technical plan to rapidly patch the identified gap.","Internal or external audit finding related to data privacy. A customer complaint regarding data handling that escalates to a legal notice.","Compliance Officer / Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-30","Not Started"
