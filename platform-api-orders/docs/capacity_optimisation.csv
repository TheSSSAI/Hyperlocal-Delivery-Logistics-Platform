"Workload Balancing","Uneven resource utilization across sprints. Mid-level dev is 28% utilized in Sprint 2 but 129% in Sprint 3. Senior dev is critically over-allocated in Sprints 3 & 4.","Shift non-dependent tasks from Sprint 3 to Sprint 2 for the Mid-level developer. Specifically, task VCS-019-T1 (License Reminder Job) can be moved earlier. Break down VCS-011-T1 into smaller sub-tasks and assign parts to the Mid-level dev.","Reduces senior dev utilization in Sprint 3 to a manageable ~80%. Increases mid-level dev utilization in Sprint 2 to ~70% and reduces their Sprint 3 load to ~85%. Mitigates burnout risk and reduces project timeline risk.","4","2 hours","Sprint 3 plan shows <95% utilization for all developers.","Reduces risk of a 2-week project delay, valued at approximately $30,000."
"Knowledge Transfer","High key-person dependency on the senior developer for all complex and asynchronous tasks.","Mandate pair programming sessions for at least 50% of the hours allocated to high-complexity tasks (VCS-008-T1, VCS-011-T1, VCS-013-T1). The mid-level developer should be the pair.","Creates skill redundancy, accelerates the mid-level developer's growth, and improves code quality for critical components. Reduces long-term project risk by 40%.","80","Ongoing","Mid-level developer can independently handle a medium-complexity async task by the end of the project.","Mitigates risk of critical project delays due to resource loss, valued at over $100,000."
