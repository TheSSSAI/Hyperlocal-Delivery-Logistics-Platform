A vendor can manually set up their entire store.","Complexity of secure S3 image upload flow. External dependency on Mapbox API.","Use pre-signed URLs for S3 uploads. Implement circuit breaker for Mapbox integration.","true","senior.backend@company.com,mid.backend@company.com,qa.engineer@company.com","Mapbox API","Mapbox integration testing on Day 5-6.","Sprint review on 2024-09-06 at 2 PM.","2024-09-06","50% of tasks completed by Day 5."
"2","Sprint 2: Operational Controls & Compliance","Implement vendor operational controls (hours, availability) and foundational compliance features (license management and auto-suspension).","2024-09-09","2024-09-20","10","17","105.6","120","88%","9","Vendor Profile and Catalog Management","Business hours management, store online/offline toggle, license CRUD with auditing, soft-delete for products, and automated license suspension job.","Show a vendor setting business hours. Toggle a store offline and verify it's unavailable. Add a license and see the audit log. Delete a product. Suspend a vendor by setting their license to expired.","All operational controls are functional. License compliance logic is implemented and tested. Cross-service call for product deletion is resilient.","Complexity of the cross-service call to Order Management for product deletion. Correct implementation of the Transactional Outbox pattern.","Define API contract with Order Management team early. Use a mock server for development. Code review focus on the outbox pattern.","true","senior.backend@company.com,mid.backend@company.com,qa.engineer@company.com","Internal Order Management Service API, Audit Log Service","Integration testing for product delete on Day 7-8.","Sprint review on 2024-09-20 at 2 PM.","2024-09-20","Linear burndown with 50% completion by Day 5."
"3","Sprint 3: Bulk Operations & Reminders","Enable efficient bulk catalog management via CSV import and automate license expiry reminders.","2024-09-23","2024-10-04","10","18","139.7","120","116%","8","Vendor Profile and Catalog Management","Asynchronous CSV product import worker, detailed error report generation for failed imports, and a scheduled job for license expiry reminders.","Upload a valid CSV and see new products appear. Upload a mixed valid/invalid CSV, see partial success, and download the error report. Show logs for the license reminder job.","Bulk import handles large files without timing out. Error reports are accurate and helpful. Reminder job correctly identifies expiring licenses.","High sprint load (116% utilization). High complexity of asynchronous CSV processing and error handling. Potential for performance issues with large files.","Dedicate senior developer to the CSV worker. Prioritize the core import logic first; if time is short, defer some error handling details to the next sprint. Proactive performance testing of the worker.","true","senior.backend@company.com,mid.backend@company.com,qa.engineer@company.com","AWS SQS","End-to-end testing of the full CSV import flow on Day 6-8.","Sprint review on 2024-10-04 at 2 PM.","2024-10-04","Monitor burndown closely; expect non-linear progress due to complexity."

'Limited Stock' threshold configuration and its effect on customer-facing product status.","Initiate a catalog export and download the resulting CSV. Set a 'Limited Stock' threshold and show how the product status changes for customers.","Bulk export handles large catalogs. 'Limited Stock' logic is correctly applied and reflected in the customer API.","Complexity of asynchronous export for very large datasets, requiring efficient data streaming.","Use Node.js streams to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory. Allocate buffer time for technical debt and final testing of the entire epic.","true","senior.backend@company.com,mid.backend@company.com,qa.engineer@company.com","AWS S3, AWS SQS","Full epic end-to-end regression testing window on Day 7-9.","Sprint review on 2024-10-18 at 2 PM.","2024-10-18","Low utilization allows for focus on quality and documentation."
