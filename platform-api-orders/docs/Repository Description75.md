# 2 Name

# 3 Description

This is the transactional core of the platform, a microservice whose sole responsibility is to manage the entire order lifecycle from start to finish. It handles cart management, order creation, and transitions the order through its various states (e.g., 'Pending', 'Accepted', 'In Transit', 'Delivered'). This service acts as the orchestrator for the order creation Saga, coordinating with other services like Payments and Vendor via events. Due to its critical, stateful nature, it must be highly available and resilient. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new granular shared libraries.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This service represents the 'Order Management' bounded context, which is the central, transactional heart of the business. Isolating this complex, stateful logic into its own service is a critical architectural decision. It allows the data model and infrastructure to be optimized for transactional integrity (ACID properties) and high-throughput writes, separate from other services.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Serves as the single source of truth for all order states and histories.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a team to focus on the most critical business workflow of the platform.
- Complex state machine logic is encapsulated and not spread across multiple services.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Cart management (add, remove, update).
- Order state machine as defined in REQ-1-077.
- Saga orchestration logic.
- Immutable order event log (REQ-1-077).

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Direct payment processing.
- Rider allocation.
- Product catalog management.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new states to the order lifecycle (e.g., 'Delayed').

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Validate that an order can only transition to valid next states.
