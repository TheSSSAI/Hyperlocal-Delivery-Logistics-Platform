"RISK-R001","Resource","Critical path is highly sequential and dependent on a single Senior Backend Developer for complex epics (Identity, Payments, Logistics), creating a major bottleneck.","High","Critical","[""CUS-001"",""CUS-025"",""CUS-028"",""SYS-006"",""WI-004-2-1""]","8","Augment the team with one additional Senior Backend Developer (contractor or full-time).","Defer non-critical backend features (e.g., advanced reporting, bulk imports) to post-MVP and re-allocate capacity to the critical path.","Velocity for backend epics drops below 80% of projection for two consecutive sprints.","60000","4 weeks to hire and onboard."
"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","The project requires complex, stateful WebSocket and distributed Saga pattern implementations. A flawed architecture or implementation will lead to severe data inconsistency and reliability issues.","Medium","Critical","[""CUS-025"",""CUS-028"",""CUS-031"",""CUS-032""]","4","Mandate formal architectural design reviews for all Sagas and WebSocket services. Implement distributed tracing from Sprint 1.","Develop idempotent reconciliation jobs to periodically correct data inconsistencies.","Rate of failed or uncompensated Saga transactions exceeds 5 per hour.","","Immediate."
"RISK-R003","External Dependency","Project is critically dependent on Razorpay (Payments) and Mapbox (Logistics). An outage or significant latency from either provider will halt core business operations.","Medium","Critical","[""CUS-025"",""SYS-006"",""SYS-007"",""RDR-017"",""CUS-028""]","","Implement Circuit Breaker pattern and contract testing for all third-party APIs.","Develop a runbook for manual refund processing and communication during a payment gateway outage.","Prometheus alert when error rate for external APIs exceeds 10% over 5 minutes.","","Immediate."
