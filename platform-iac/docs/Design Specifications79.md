# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Definitive source of truth for provisioning all AWS cloud infrastructure for the platform.
- Manages network (VPCs), compute (EKS), persistence (RDS), messaging (SQS/SNS), and security (IAM) resources.
- Strictly excludes application code, container images, or business logic implementation.
- Responsible for creating and managing distinct, isolated infrastructure for Development, Staging, and Production environments.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Terraform (HCL)
- AWS Provider for Terraform

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Infrastructure must be defined declaratively and be version-controlled in Git.
- Must support a multi-environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) deployment strategy with strict network isolation between environments.
- All provisioned resources must adhere to security best practices, including encryption at rest and least-privilege IAM policies.
- The provisioned infrastructure must be highly available and fault-tolerant, leveraging Multi-AZ deployments for critical components like EKS and RDS.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Provider Of', 'target_component': 'All Application Repositories', 'integration_pattern': 'Infrastructure Provisioning', 'reasoning': "This repository provides the foundational cloud infrastructure (VPCs, EKS Cluster, RDS Database) upon which all application microservices are deployed. The CI/CD pipelines for application repositories will consume outputs from this repository's Terraform state (e.g., EKS cluster endpoint, VPC IDs)."}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-iac' repository is the bedrock of the entire system, translating architectural and non-functional requirements into tangible, version-controlled cloud resources. Its successful implementation is a critical-path dependency for all other development activities. The design must prioritize modularity (via Terraform modules) to manage complexity and ensure reusability across environments. A robust remote state management strategy is non-negotiable for team collaboration and operational stability.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

*No items available*

## 3.2.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Technical

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-007: The system shall be architected as a cloud-native application using a microservices pattern. All infrastructure and services shall be hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

This repository will use the AWS Terraform provider to define all resources. The structure will include modules for EKS, RDS, VPC, and other AWS services to support a microservices architecture.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- Locked into the AWS ecosystem.
- All resource definitions must be compatible with the AWS provider.

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary directive mandating the technology choice (AWS) and architectural support (microservices) for this repository.

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Technical

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-016: The system's production environment shall be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) within the 'ap-south-1' (Mumbai) region. The infrastructure must be configured to span multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ).

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

The AWS provider configuration will be hardcoded with 'region = "ap-south-1"'. Resources like VPC subnets, EKS node groups, and RDS instances will be defined with configurations that explicitly distribute them across multiple AZs (e.g., 'ap-south-1a', 'ap-south-1b').

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- Data residency is restricted to the Mumbai region.
- Infrastructure design must accommodate Multi-AZ patterns for all critical services.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates the specific geographic and high-availability constraints for the production infrastructure definition.

### 3.2.3.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1 Requirement Type

Technical

#### 3.2.3.2 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-017: The project shall maintain a minimum of three separate environments: Development, Staging, and Production. Each environment must be deployed in its own dedicated Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure strict network isolation.

#### 3.2.3.3 Implementation Impact

The Terraform project will be structured with an 'environments' directory containing subdirectories for 'dev', 'staging', and 'prod'. Each subdirectory will instantiate a shared VPC module to create a logically and network-isolated environment.

#### 3.2.3.4 Design Constraints

- Requires careful management of Terraform state files for each environment.
- Increases resource costs due to duplication of infrastructure across environments.

#### 3.2.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly shapes the repository's directory structure and state management strategy to enforce environment separation.

### 3.2.4.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.4.1 Requirement Type

Technical

#### 3.2.4.2 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-111: The project shall be implemented using the following mandated technology stack: ... Infrastructure: AWS, Amazon EKS, Terraform ...

#### 3.2.4.3 Implementation Impact

This repository must be implemented solely using Terraform to provision AWS resources. The core compute platform to be provisioned is Amazon EKS.

#### 3.2.4.4 Design Constraints

- The use of other IaC tools like CloudFormation or Pulumi is prohibited.
- The infrastructure must be designed around Kubernetes as the orchestration platform.

#### 3.2.4.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement explicitly mandates the use of Terraform, making it the core technology for this repository.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

This repository's primary function is to implement the platform's foundational technical and non-functional requirements. It translates high-level needs like high availability (REQ-1-016), security (implicit in dedicated VPCs, REQ-1-017), and technology stack compliance (REQ-1-111, REQ-1-007) into specific, declarative infrastructure code. There are no direct functional requirements, as its outputs are consumed by application deployment processes rather than end-users.

# 4.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1 Pattern Name

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### 4.1.1.2 Pattern Application

The entire state of the cloud infrastructure is defined in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) using Terraform. This enables version control, automated provisioning, and consistent environment replication.

#### 4.1.1.3 Required Components

- Terraform CLI
- Git Repository
- Remote State Backend (AWS S3)

#### 4.1.1.4 Implementation Strategy

A modular Terraform project structure will be used. A central repository ('platform-iac') will define modules for reusable components (VPC, EKS, RDS), which are then composed within environment-specific configurations ('/environments/dev', '/environments/prod').

#### 4.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

IaC is the industry-standard pattern for managing modern cloud infrastructure, directly supporting the requirements for maintainability, scalability, and automated deployments.

### 4.1.2.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1 Pattern Name

Modular Architecture (Terraform Modules)

#### 4.1.2.2 Pattern Application

Logical units of infrastructure (e.g., networking, Kubernetes cluster, database) will be encapsulated into self-contained Terraform modules with defined inputs (variables) and outputs.

#### 4.1.2.3 Required Components

- Terraform module directories (e.g., 'modules/vpc', 'modules/eks')

#### 4.1.2.4 Implementation Strategy

Each module will be stored in the '/modules' directory. Environment configurations will instantiate these modules, passing environment-specific parameters (like VPC CIDR blocks or instance sizes).

#### 4.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for managing the complexity of the platform's infrastructure, promoting code reuse, and reducing the blast radius of changes.

## 4.2.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1 Integration Type

Cloud Provider API

#### 4.2.1.2 Target Components

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

#### 4.2.1.3 Communication Pattern

Synchronous API Calls

#### 4.2.1.4 Interface Requirements

- AWS Provider for Terraform
- IAM Credentials with sufficient permissions for provisioning resources

#### 4.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary integration point. Terraform translates the HCL code into a series of API calls to AWS to create, update, or delete resources.

### 4.2.2.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1 Integration Type

CI/CD Pipeline

#### 4.2.2.2 Target Components

- GitHub Actions

#### 4.2.2.3 Communication Pattern

Event-driven (on git push/merge)

#### 4.2.2.4 Interface Requirements

- Workflow files ('.github/workflows/')
- Secure access to AWS credentials (e.g., via OIDC)

#### 4.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

The CI/CD system is the execution engine for Terraform. It automates the process of planning and applying infrastructure changes in a controlled and auditable manner, as specified in REQ-1-111.
