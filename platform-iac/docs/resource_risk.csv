"RISK-008","Timeline","The project contains numerous high-priority, interdependent features that form a critical path for the MVP launch. A delay in any single foundational story will have a cascading effect, delaying all dependent features and risking a significant timeline slip.","High","High","[""VND-001-T2"",""CUS-011-T1"",""CUS-025-T1"",""RDR-010-T1""]","4","Explicitly map all dependencies in project management tool. Define clear API contracts early to allow for parallel development. Maintain a small backlog of lower-priority 'nice-to-have' features that can be de-scoped.","Re-evaluate MVP scope if a critical path feature is significantly delayed. Communicate potential delays to stakeholders early and transparently.","A critical path user story slipping its sprint deadline by more than 3 days.","","Ongoing"
"RISK-002","External","The system has critical dependencies on third-party APIs (Razorpay, Mapbox, FCM) for core functionality. An outage, API change, or significant latency could cripple major user-facing features.","High","High","[""CUS-025"",""RDR-014"",""CUS-030""]","1","Implement resilience patterns for all external API calls: circuit breakers, exponential backoff retries, and request timeouts. Implement contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline.","For mapping failure, disable live tracking. For payment gateway failure, enable COD only. For notification failure, rely on in-app status updates.","A spike in 5xx error rates for outbound API calls to any third-party service.","","2 weeks to implement"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project's technology stack is extensive and complex. There is a significant risk that the team lacks deep, production-level expertise in all areas (Kubernetes, PostGIS, OpenSearch), leading to suboptimal implementation or delays.","Medium","High","[""ADM-013"",""CUS-011""]","3","Conduct a formal skills gap analysis. Allocate budget for targeted training or expert consultation for critical areas. Enforce pair programming for complex infrastructure changes.","De-scope complex features or opt for simpler managed AWS services initially.","Recurring delays in infrastructure-related tasks.","10000","4 weeks to implement"
