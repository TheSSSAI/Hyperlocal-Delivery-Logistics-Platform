# 3 Description

This repository is the single source of truth for the entire platform's cloud infrastructure, defined as code using Terraform. It is responsible for provisioning and managing all AWS resources, including the VPCs, EKS cluster, RDS database instances, IAM roles and policies, SQS queues, SNS topics, and the API Gateway configuration. This ensures that the infrastructure is version-controlled, auditable, and can be replicated consistently across different environments (Development, Staging, Production). Its scope is strictly limited to infrastructure definition and does not contain any application code.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Separating infrastructure code from application code is a fundamental best practice. This repository has a clear, singular responsibility. It allows the infrastructure team or SREs to manage the cloud environment independently of application developers. Changes to infrastructure can be planned, reviewed, and applied through a dedicated CI/CD pipeline, providing safety and auditability.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Terraform modules within this repository (e.g., for creating a standard microservice on EKS) can be reused.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables automated, repeatable environment creation.
- Provides a clear audit trail for all infrastructure changes.
- Decouples infrastructure lifecycle from application lifecycle.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Definitions for all AWS resources.
- Networking configuration (VPCs, subnets, security groups).
- IAM roles and policies.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any application source code.
- Kubernetes deployment manifests (these belong with the application code).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new environments or AWS regions.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Use 'terraform validate' and linting in the CI pipeline.
