"RISK-001","Technical","The atomic CSV import process (VND-013, VND-014) is highly complex, involving asynchronous processing, S3 streaming, and transactional database operations. A bug in this worker could lead to partial data imports or irreversible catalog corruption, severely impacting vendor trust and data integrity.","3","5","15","High","VND-013, VND-014, VND-015. Specifically, work items WI-VCS-010, WI-VCS-011, and WI-VCS-012 which detail the SQS consumer, validation engine, and DB operations.","High complexity of distributed, asynchronous transactions combined with the destructive potential of bulk data operations. A single logical error in the worker could affect thousands of product records.","Implement a robust transactional outbox pattern for database operations. Enforce extensive integration testing with a wide range of malformed CSVs. Implement strict, schema-based validation at the start of the job. All code for the worker must undergo senior developer review.","The import job must log its `jobId` against every product it creates/updates. In case of catastrophic failure, a runbook will detail the process to revert the import by deleting all products associated with the failed `jobId`.","Any message landing in the SQS Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for the import worker. An import job running longer than the configured timeout (e.g., 10 minutes). A sudden spike in failed job statuses.","Backend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The system has critical dependencies on third-party APIs (Razorpay, Mapbox, FCM) for core functionality like payments, routing, and notifications (REQ-1-008, REQ-1-090). An outage, API change, or significant latency from any of these providers could cripple major user-facing features.","4","4","16","High","CUS-025 (Online Payment), RDR-014 (Navigation), CUS-030 (Push Notifications). The entire payment and delivery logistics chain is at risk.","Delegation of core, non-differentiating functionality to specialized external services. This introduces dependencies outside the team's direct control.","Implement resilience patterns for all external API calls as per REQ-1-028: circuit breakers, exponential backoff retries, and request timeouts. Implement contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline to detect breaking API changes early (REQ-1-091).","For mapping/routing failure, disable live tracking and fall back to displaying static addresses. For payment gateway failure, disable online payments and show only Cash on Delivery (COD). For notification failure, rely on in-app status updates and log failures for later analysis.","A spike in 5xx error rates for outbound API calls to any third-party service. Circuit breaker state changing to 'Open'. An increase in API latency beyond defined SLOs.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-28","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Technical","The product deletion flow (VND-011, WI-VCS-006) requires a synchronous API call from the Vendor & Catalog service to the Order Management service. This creates tight coupling and a single point of failure. An outage or high latency in the Order service will directly block vendors from managing their catalogs.","3","4","12","Medium","VND-011 (Vendor Deletes a Product), WI-VCS-006 (Implement CRUD API for Products). This impacts a core vendor catalog management feature.","Architectural decision to use a synchronous request-response pattern for a cross-service validation check, which violates the principle of service autonomy and resilience.","Implement a circuit breaker and aggressive timeouts for the API call. Long term, refactor this flow to be asynchronous: the vendor service marks the product as 'pending_deletion', publishes an event, and a consumer in the Order service validates and confirms the deletion.","If the Order service is unavailable, the delete feature should be temporarily disabled in the UI, showing a message 'Product management is temporarily unavailable'. The API should return a 503 Service Unavailable error.","An alert fires when the latency of the 'check active orders' API call exceeds 500ms. An alert fires on a >5% failure rate for this specific endpoint.","Backend Architect","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","The Continuous Deployment pipeline (WI-VCS-020) deploys to production on every merge to the main branch. A bug that bypasses CI checks (e.g., a flawed integration test) could be deployed automatically, causing a production outage with no manual gate for intervention.","2","5","10","Medium","The entire platform's stability. All features provided by the Vendor & Catalog service are at risk of downtime.","High degree of automation in the deployment process without sufficient safety gates or a robust rollback strategy.","Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy instead of a simple rolling update. The CD pipeline should include a mandatory, automated E2E smoke test against the newly deployed environment before shifting 100% of traffic.","Develop a one-click automated rollback procedure in the GitHub Actions pipeline that can be triggered manually in case of an incident. Ensure the previous stable Docker image is retained in ECR.","A post-deployment spike in the 5xx error rate for the service. A sudden drop in request throughput. A failure in the post-deployment smoke test.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The system's real-time features, such as live tracking (CUS-028) and chat (CUS-031), rely on WebSockets. Testing the reliability, reconnection logic, and state management of these features under various network conditions (flaky 4G, Wi-Fi to cellular handover) is notoriously difficult to automate, creating a risk of shipping bugs that severely impact user experience.","4","3","12","Medium","CUS-028, CUS-029, CUS-031, CUS-032, RDR-028, VND-024. All real-time communication features.","Inherent complexity of stateful, real-time communication and the difficulty of simulating real-world mobile network conditions in an automated CI/CD environment.","Invest in a dedicated E2E testing framework capable of managing multiple concurrent user sessions (e.g., Cypress). Supplement automated tests with a rigorous manual testing plan using network link conditioners and testing on physical devices.","Develop a feature flag to disable chat functionality if a critical bug is found in production. For tracking, the system already has a fallback to showing the last known location, which serves as a contingency.","A high rate of WebSocket connection drops or failed handshake attempts. A spike in customer support tickets related to 'frozen' maps or unsent chat messages.","QA Lead","2025-04-30","In Progress"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project's technology stack (REQ-1-111, TASK BREAKDOWN) is extensive and complex, including Kubernetes, Terraform, PostGIS, and OpenSearch. There is a significant risk that the team lacks deep, production-level expertise in all these areas, leading to suboptimal implementation, security flaws, or timeline delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All infrastructure and backend tasks, particularly ADM-013 (Geofencing with PostGIS), CUS-011 (Search with OpenSearch), and the entire CI/CD and deployment workstream (WS-VCS-007, WS-VCS-008).","Adoption of a modern, but complex, technology stack without a formal assessment of the team's existing skill set and experience.","Conduct a formal skills gap analysis. Allocate budget for targeted training or expert consultation for critical areas like Kubernetes security and OpenSearch performance tuning. Enforce pair programming and rigorous code reviews for complex infrastructure changes.","If skill gaps cannot be filled, de-scope complex features or opt for managed AWS services where possible (e.g., using a simpler database search feature instead of a full OpenSearch cluster initially).","Recurring delays in infrastructure-related tasks. An increase in bugs or performance issues related to a specific technology area (e.g., slow geospatial queries).","Engineering Manager","2025-02-15","In Progress"
"RISK-007","Security","The platform handles sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data, with strict compliance requirements (DPDP Act, REQ-1-021; PCI-DSS, REQ-1-098). A failure in implementing RBAC, data encryption (REQ-1-097), or secure coding practices could lead to a severe data breach, resulting in legal penalties, financial loss, and catastrophic reputational damage.","2","5","10","Medium","CUS-001 (Registration), CUS-006 (Profile Mgmt), VND-001 (Registration), CUS-025 (Payment), RDR-007 (Bank Details). All features handling PII.","The inherent risk of handling sensitive data in a complex, multi-service application. A single vulnerability in any microservice could potentially compromise user data.","Mandate security reviews as part of the definition of done for all features handling PII. Automate security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. Conduct a mandatory third-party penetration test before public launch as per REQ-1-098. Enforce the principle of least privilege for all IAM roles and service-to-service communication.","Develop and rehearse an incident response plan for a potential data breach, including steps for containment, investigation, and user notification. Maintain immutable audit logs (REQ-1-013) to aid in forensic analysis.","Alerts from AWS GuardDuty or security scanning tools. A high rate of 403 Forbidden errors, which could indicate authorization probing. Any unauthorized access attempts logged in the audit trail.","Security Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The project contains numerous high-priority, interdependent features that form a critical path for the MVP launch (e.g., Registration -> Login -> Vendor Onboarding -> Product Creation -> Order Placement -> Delivery). A delay in any single foundational story, such as vendor registration (VND-001), will have a cascading effect, delaying all dependent features and risking a significant timeline slip.","4","4","16","High","The entire project timeline, particularly the phased rollout in Mumbai (REQ-1-112). All user stories marked 'High' priority are on this critical path.","Tightly coupled feature dependencies inherent in building a new platform from the ground up. Lack of buffer in the schedule for unforeseen complexities.","Use a project management tool to explicitly map all dependencies. Prioritize critical path tasks ruthlessly. Define clear API contracts early to allow for parallel development. Maintain a small backlog of lower-priority 'nice-to-have' features that can be de-scoped to protect the launch date.","If a critical path feature is significantly delayed, re-evaluate the MVP scope. For example, if bulk import (VND-013) is delayed, launch with manual product entry only. Communicate any potential delays to stakeholders early and transparently.","A critical path user story slipping its sprint deadline by more than 3 days. A key dependency (e.g., an API contract) not being finalized by its due date.","Project Manager","2025-02-10","In Progress"
