"Cross-training","Single point of failure on OpenSearch expertise (Backend Lead).","Dedicate 8 hours per sprint for the Backend Lead to cross-train the Senior Fullstack Developer on OpenSearch fundamentals, including query optimization and index management.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 50% within 2 sprints.","16","8 weeks","Senior Fullstack Developer can independently handle medium-complexity OpenSearch tasks.","Mitigates risk of project delay worth an estimated $30,000."
"Process Improvement","High coordination overhead due to tightly coupled dependencies.","Mandate the creation and formal sign-off of API contracts (OpenAPI spec) for all new inter-service communication before implementation begins.","Enables true parallel development between frontend and backend, potentially reducing sprint cycle time for integrated features by 15%.","8","Immediate","Reduction in 'blocked' time for tasks in the project management tool.","Accelerates time-to-market and improves development flow."
