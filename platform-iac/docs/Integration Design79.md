The system shall be architected as a cloud-native application using a microservices pattern. All infrastructure and services shall be hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Confirm that all system components are deployed on AWS infrastructure.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The Terraform code within this repository must exclusively define resources within the AWS ecosystem.
- Resource definitions must support a cloud-native approach, such as using managed services (RDS, EKS, SQS) rather than self-hosted alternatives.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This repository is the primary instrument for implementing the AWS hosting requirement. It defines the foundational cloud environment for all other services.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-016

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system's production environment shall be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) within the ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region. The infrastructure must be configured to span multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Inspect the AWS infrastructure configuration to confirm deployment in the ap-south-1 region.
- Verify that critical components like the database and application servers are deployed across at least two different Availability Zones.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-017

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The project shall maintain a minimum of three separate environments: Development, Staging, and Production. Each environment must be deployed in its own dedicated Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure strict network isolation.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Confirm the existence of three distinct environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) in AWS.
- Verify that each environment resides in a separate VPC...

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must be structured to manage configurations for at least three distinct environments (e.g., using Terraform workspaces or a tool like Terragrunt).
- The Terraform code must define a separate VPC with its own networking configuration for each environment.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This repository is responsible for creating the distinct, isolated environments mandated by this requirement. The structure of the Terraform code must directly reflect this multi-environment strategy.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'InfrastructureProvisioner', 'component_specification': 'This logical component represents the entire set of Terraform configurations and modules within the repository. Its sole responsibility is to define, provision, manage the state of, and update all cloud infrastructure resources required by the platform in a version-controlled, repeatable, and auditable manner.', 'implementation_requirements': ['Must be written in HCL for the Terraform framework.', 'Must use a remote state backend (e.g., AWS S3 with DynamoDB for locking) to manage state securely.', 'Must be structured into reusable modules for different resource types (e.g., VPC, EKS Cluster, RDS Instance, SQS Queue) to promote consistency and maintainability.', 'Must be capable of managing multiple, isolated environments (Dev, Staging, Production).'], 'architectural_context': "This component is the concrete implementation of the 'Infrastructure as Code' pattern. It is foundational and precedes the application layer, as it creates the environment where applications will be deployed.", 'extraction_reasoning': 'The entire repository acts as a single, cohesive component whose purpose is to implement Infrastructure as Code, which is a core architectural decision and fulfills several key technical requirements.'}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

### 1.4.1.0 Layer Name

#### 1.4.1.1 Layer Name

Infrastructure Layer

#### 1.4.1.2 Layer Responsibilities

This repository provisions all resources for the Infrastructure Layer, including the primary PostgreSQL database on RDS, distributed cache on ElastiCache, object storage on S3, and the observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana setup on EKS, CloudWatch Log Groups). It also defines the AWS Cognito User Pools for identity.

#### 1.4.1.3 Layer Constraints

- All resources must be provisioned with encryption at rest enabled.
- Database resources must be configured for high availability (Multi-AZ) and automated backups.
- IAM policies must adhere to the principle of least privilege.

#### 1.4.1.4 Implementation Patterns
