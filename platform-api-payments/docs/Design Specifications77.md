# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Manage all monetary transactions including payment processing (via Razorpay), refund initiation, platform commission calculation, and weekly financial settlements for vendors and riders.
- Secondary: Maintain an immutable double-entry financial ledger for all transactions, ensure PCI-DSS compliance by isolating payment logic, and manage secure integration with external payment gateways.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (TypeScript) for the application framework, leveraging its modular architecture for separating concerns like payments, settlements, and the ledger.
- PostgreSQL as the primary persistence layer for storing financial transaction records, payments, and payouts.
- TypeORM as the ORM for managing database interactions and migrations.
- Redis for caching frequently accessed configuration data (e.g., commission rates) and for managing stateful security mechanisms (e.g., failed payment attempt counters).

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must strictly adhere to PCI-DSS compliance standards by never storing sensitive cardholder data, relying on Razorpay's tokenization.
- All external API calls to Razorpay must be wrapped in resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) as per REQ-1-028.
- The service must function as a decoupled microservice within an event-driven architecture, primarily consuming events and operating asynchronously to ensure high reliability.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

platform-api-order

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Event-driven via SNS/SQS

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

The Payments service is a downstream consumer of critical order lifecycle events. It listens for 'order.delivered' to trigger commission calculation (REQ-1-082) and 'order.cancelled' to initiate refunds (REQ-1-031), ensuring financial operations are decoupled from the core order workflow.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 External API Integration: Razorpay / RazorpayX

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

External API Integration

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

Razorpay / RazorpayX

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

Synchronous API Calls via SDK

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

This is the primary external dependency for all payment processing (REQ-1-090) and bulk payouts (REQ-1-085). The service encapsulates all interactions with Razorpay to maintain a single point of integration for financial gateways.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Data Consumer / Internal API: platform-api-vendor, platform-api-rider

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a dedicated database schema with a 'FinancialTransaction' table to act as an immutable ledger.
- A 'LedgerService' must be implemented to ensure all financial operations create corresponding debit and credit entries.
- The service must store calculation inputs (order value, commission rate) with the transaction record to ensure auditability.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- FinancialTransaction Entity/Model
- LedgerService
- CommissionCalculationService

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the core architectural requirement for the service, dictating its primary data model and business logic to ensure financial integrity and auditability.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-090

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Integrate with third-party services, specifically Razorpay for payment processing.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated 'RazorpayService' must be created to encapsulate the Razorpay SDK and manage all interactions, including creating payment intents, handling webhooks, and initiating refunds.
- The service must have a publicly exposed webhook endpoint (via API Gateway) to receive payment status updates from Razorpay.
- API keys must be stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager and accessed at runtime.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- RazorpayService
- RazorpayWebhookController

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement defines the primary external integration and the mechanism for payment capture, which is a critical function of this service.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

PCI-DSS compliance, encryption at rest and in transit, and immutable audit trails for all financial events.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The service must avoid storing any sensitive cardholder data. All data persisted in PostgreSQL must have encryption enabled at the RDS level. Every state-changing financial operation must publish an event to the central audit log service.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Utilize Razorpay's tokenization/hosted checkout to avoid handling raw payment credentials.
- API keys must be managed via AWS Secrets Manager.
- Database transactions must ensure an audit log is created before the financial record is committed.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Due to its financial nature, this service has the most stringent security requirements, which heavily influence its architecture and implementation details.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Reliability & Resilience

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Robust error handling, circuit breakers for external APIs, and a defined fallback for payment confirmations.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

All Razorpay API calls must be wrapped in a resilience library (e.g., Polly.js or custom interceptor). A scheduled job (Kubernetes CronJob) and a dedicated service ('ReconciliationService') must be implemented to handle orders stuck in a 'payment_pending_confirmation' state as per REQ-1-058.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- The service's event consumers must be idempotent to handle message retries safely.
- Webhook endpoints must verify signatures and be designed to handle duplicate deliveries from Razorpay.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Financial transactions are critical and cannot be lost. The requirements for reconciliation and resilience patterns are non-negotiable for ensuring data integrity and preventing revenue loss.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The service's requirements are heavily skewed towards non-functional aspects, particularly security and reliability. The functional requirements define a classic payments and settlements system, but the implementation must be guided by the need for auditability, resilience against external failures, and strict security controls.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as a consumer of events from the Order service (e.g., 'OrderCancelled', 'OrderDelivered') and a producer of financial events (e.g., 'PaymentSucceeded', 'PayoutCompleted'), ensuring loose coupling and high resilience.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- SqsEventConsumer
- SnsEventPublisher
- OrderEventHandlers

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement NestJS listeners or services that are triggered by messages from an SQS queue. On successful processing, publish new events to an SNS topic for other downstream services.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This aligns with the system-wide architecture (REQ-1-105) and is the most reliable pattern for handling critical, asynchronous workflows like refunds and commission calculations post-order completion.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Saga

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The initial order placement and payment process will be managed using a choreographed Saga. This service is responsible for the 'Process Payment' step, which includes interacting with Razorpay and publishing a success or failure event to continue or compensate the Saga.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- PaymentSagaCoordinator (or event handlers acting as such)
- RazorpayService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The service will listen for an 'OrderCreatedPendingPayment' event. It will then attempt payment processing. If successful, it publishes a 'PaymentSucceeded' event. If it fails, it publishes a 'PaymentFailed' event, allowing the Order service to compensate by cancelling the order.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

REQ-1-105 mandates this pattern for distributed transactions. It's essential for maintaining data consistency between the Order and Payments services during the critical checkout phase.
