"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Security","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user account is temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed OTP login attempts, as per REQ-FUN-002.","High - Failure to lock accounts allows for brute-force attacks, leading to account takeover and fraud.","Medium","A valid customer account exists. The OTP login screen is accessible. A Redis instance is available for tracking failed attempts.","1. Navigate to the login screen. 2. Enter the valid mobile number and request an OTP. 3. Intentionally enter an incorrect OTP 5 times in a row. 4. After the 5th failure, verify the lockout error message. 5. Immediately attempt to request a new OTP for the same number.","After the 5th incorrect OTP, a specific lockout error message is displayed. The subsequent attempt to request a new OTP is blocked with an error indicating the account is locked for a configured duration.","A registered customer mobile number. A mechanism to retrieve the correct OTP for baseline tests.","Cypress (or Appium/Detox for mobile); Redis client for verification.","3","6","1","Identity & Access Service, Redis (ElastiCache), AWS SNS","Staging environment with access to Redis and notification logs.","Account is locked on the 5th attempt. No new OTPs can be generated during the lockout period.","Critical - High security vulnerability.","Every release","Low","Clear the failed attempt counter and lockout key for the test user in Redis.","This test directly validates a critical security control against brute-force attacks.","Each OTP validation attempt should respond in <200ms.","The error message must be announced by screen readers."
"TEST-ORDER-001","Order Placement","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the Order Creation Saga's compensating transaction for a failed payment after inventory reservation, as per REQ-ARC-001.","Critical - Failure leads to data inconsistency: held inventory with no payment, or charged customers with no order.","High","Order Service, Payment Service, and Vendor Service are running. A customer has a valid cart.","1. Initiate an order placement API call. 2. The saga begins: Inventory is reserved in the Vendor Service. 3. The Payment Service attempts to process the payment. 4. Mock the payment gateway to return a failure. 5. The Payment Service publishes a `PaymentFailed` event. 6. The saga orchestrator receives the event and initiates compensating transactions.","The Order Service marks the order as 'Failed'. The Vendor Service receives a 'ReleaseInventory' command and restores the stock count. No charge is made to the customer. All states are consistent.","A valid customer session with items in cart. A mock for the payment gateway API.","Jest (for backend integration tests); A mock server (e.g., WireMock); AWS SQS/SNS test utilities.","8","16","4","Order Service, Payment Service, Vendor Service, AWS SQS/SNS","Integration test environment with mocked external dependencies.","Inventory is correctly released. Order status is 'Failed'. No financial transaction is recorded.","Critical - Direct revenue loss and inventory mismanagement.","Every release","High","Reset product inventory; Delete failed order record.","The saga must be resilient to event tampering or replay attacks.","The entire compensation flow should complete in under 5 seconds.","N/A"
"TEST-TRACK-001","Live Delivery Tracking","Performance","E2E","High","true","Medium","Verify that the end-to-end latency for real-time location updates meets the < 2 second requirement, as per REQ-FUN-008.","High - High latency degrades the core user experience of live tracking, reducing customer trust and satisfaction.","High","A customer has an 'In Transit' order. A test rider is assigned. The WebSocket service is operational.","1. Set up a test script for the 'rider' client to send a location payload with a high-precision timestamp. 2. Set up a test script for the 'customer' client to listen for the WebSocket event. 3. The rider script sends a location update. 4. The customer script receives the location update and records its arrival timestamp. 5. Calculate the delta between the send and receive timestamps over 1,000 iterations.","The 95th percentile of the measured latency delta is under 2 seconds.","A valid order in the 'In Transit' state. Test accounts for a customer and rider.","Custom test scripts (e.g., using k6 with WebSocket support), a high-precision time synchronization service (NTP).","10","20","5","Rider Logistics Service, WebSocket Service, Customer App, Rider App","Performance environment with a deployed stack. Test clients must be geographically distributed to simulate real-world conditions.","P95 latency < 2000ms.","High - Feature does not meet its core NFR, leading to poor UX.","Before every major release","Medium","Terminate test orders.","Ensure test scripts authenticate securely to the WebSocket service.","This test case defines the performance expectation.","N/A"
"TEST-ADMIN-001","Administrator Privileges","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that any data modification action by an Administrator is recorded in the immutable audit trail, as per REQ-NFR-008.","Critical - Lack of an audit trail is a major compliance and security failure, preventing incident investigation and accountability.","Medium","An Administrator account and a target user account (e.g., a Customer) exist. The Audit Log service is running.","1. Authenticate as the Administrator. 2. Make an API call to suspend the target Customer account. 3. Upon receiving a success response, immediately make an API call to the Audit Log service to query for recent events. 4. Filter for events related to the target Customer ID.","A new audit log entry is found that contains the administrator's ID, the action taken ('user.suspend'), the target user's ID, a timestamp, and the changed data.","Admin account, Customer account.","Jest (for backend integration tests), Postman.","4","8","2","Identity & Access Service, Audit Log Service","Integration test environment.","An accurate audit log entry is created for every admin-initiated state change.","Critical - Regulatory compliance failure and inability to perform security forensics.","Every release","Low","Reactivate the suspended user.","This test verifies a fundamental security logging control.","The audit log event should be created asynchronously and not add >50ms to the original API call latency.","N/A"
