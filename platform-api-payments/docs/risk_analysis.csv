"RISK-001","External","A major outage or API breaking change from a critical third-party service (e.g., Razorpay for payments, Mapbox for logistics) could halt core platform functionality, directly stopping revenue generation or delivery operations.","4","5","20","High","All payment processing (CUS-025), live tracking (CUS-028), rider navigation (RDR-014, RDR-017), and address geocoding (CUS-007) functionalities.","Heavy dependency on external, non-controlled services for core business functions, as mandated by the system architecture (REQ-1-090).","Implement and test robust Circuit Breaker, retry with exponential backoff, and fallback mechanisms for all third-party integrations as per REQ-1-028. Pin API versions and use contract testing in the CI/CD pipeline to detect breaking changes early (REQ-1-091).","Develop and maintain operational runbooks for each critical third-party service outage. For payment gateway failure, this includes communicating with users and manually reconciling transactions. For mapping failure, temporarily disable live tracking and provide static addresses to riders.","A sustained increase in 5xx error rates or API call latency from any external service, monitored via Prometheus and Grafana, triggering an Alertmanager alert (REQ-1-109).","DevOps Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure in the distributed transaction (Saga pattern) for order creation leads to data inconsistency between Order, Payment, and Vendor services, resulting in lost orders, incorrect financial records, or unfulfilled but paid-for orders.","3","5","15","High","Core order placement workflow (CUS-025, CUS-026), financial ledger integrity (REQ-1-082), and vendor order notification (VND-016).","Inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency across multiple microservices (REQ-1-105) without distributed ACID transactions.","Rigorously implement compensating transactions for every step of the order creation saga. Utilize the Transactional Outbox pattern to guarantee event publication upon database commit. Conduct extensive integration testing focused on saga failure and recovery scenarios.","Create a reconciliation service or script to periodically scan for and fix inconsistent order states. Generate high-priority alerts for any saga that fails to complete, enabling manual intervention by the operations team based on a runbook.","A Prometheus metric tracking the count of 'incomplete' or 'failed' sagas exceeds zero, triggering an immediate P1 alert.","Backend Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Project timeline is significantly delayed due to the high number of complex, interdependent features and potential for estimation errors in unfamiliar technologies like service mesh (App Mesh) and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry).","4","4","16","High","Overall project go-live date, particularly affecting complex epics such as 'Foundational Setup & Authentication' and 'Monitoring & Support Tools'.","An ambitious, feature-rich scope combined with a complex, modern technology stack (REQ-1-111, REQ-1-104) that has a steep learning curve.","Rigorously prioritize features for the MVP, moving non-essential items to a post-launch backlog. Break down large epics into smaller, two-week deliverables. Employ time-boxed technical spikes for unfamiliar technologies to de-risk implementation.","Maintain a 'scope-shedding' list of lower-priority features (e.g., advanced reporting, some admin configurations) that can be deferred to meet the launch date for core functionality. Secure budget for strategic contractor hiring to fill critical, short-term skill gaps.","Sprint-over-sprint velocity is more than 20% below the projected plan. A critical path task is delayed by more than one sprint.","Project Manager","2025-02-28","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Quality","The real-time WebSocket infrastructure for live tracking and chat fails to perform reliably under the target load of 10,000 concurrent users, leading to high latency, message loss, and a poor customer experience.","3","4","12","Medium","Live Delivery Tracking (REQ-1-059), In-App Chat (REQ-1-081), and all related user stories (CUS-028, CUS-031, CUS-032, RDR-028).","The inherent complexity of scaling and maintaining stateful WebSocket connections compared to stateless REST APIs, especially on unreliable mobile networks.","Implement the WebSocket service using a scalable solution like Socket.IO with a Redis adapter for horizontal scaling. Conduct dedicated load tests simulating 10k+ concurrent connections with high message frequency. Optimize message payloads to be lightweight.","Develop a client-side fallback mechanism where critical status updates (e.g., 'Delivered') are sent via a reliable REST API call if WebSocket delivery confirmation is not received within a timeout. For live tracking, the app can fall back to periodic polling.","WebSocket connection error rate exceeds 2% or P95 message latency exceeds 2 seconds in production monitoring (Grafana).","Backend Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","Skill gaps within the development team for highly specialized technologies, such as Kubernetes, AWS App Mesh (Service Mesh), and the Saga pattern, lead to poor implementation quality, increased technical debt, and schedule delays.","3","4","12","Medium","Microservice deployment and communication (REQ-1-106), order creation workflow (REQ-1-105), and overall system stability and observability.","The project's technology stack (REQ-1-111) is broad and includes niche, complex technologies that require specialized expertise.","Conduct a team-wide skills matrix assessment. Allocate budget for specialized training and professional services from AWS or a certified partner. Institute mandatory pair programming and rigorous code reviews for all work related to these complex components.","Develop a simplified, interim architectural solution. For example, defer the service mesh implementation in favor of direct service-to-service communication with client-side load balancing for the initial launch if the team cannot achieve proficiency in time.","Key tasks related to EKS, App Mesh, or Saga implementation are repeatedly blocked or delayed across multiple sprints. Code reviews consistently identify fundamental architectural misunderstandings.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Security","Improper implementation of data handling for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fails to comply with India's DPDP Act 2023, leading to significant legal liability, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.","2","5","10","Medium","User onboarding (CUS-001, VND-001, RDR-001), data erasure (CUS-043), and consent management (CUS-042). All handling of user profiles and addresses.","Complex legal requirements of a new data protection law (REQ-1-021) that may be misinterpreted by the development team, coupled with PII being distributed across multiple microservices.","Engage legal counsel specializing in the DPDP Act to review the implementation plan. Create a comprehensive 'PII Data Map' identifying every PII attribute across all services. Mandate security-focused code reviews for all features handling PII and conduct dedicated training for the team on DPDP principles.","In case of a compliance gap discovery post-launch, have an incident response plan that includes immediate remediation, user notification protocols, and communication with regulatory bodies. Prepare to temporarily disable non-compliant features if necessary.","An internal or external audit identifies a gap in compliance. A high-severity finding related to PII handling is reported during a pre-launch penetration test (REQ-1-098).","Security Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
