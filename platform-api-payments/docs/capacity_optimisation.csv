"QA Bottleneck Resolution","A single resource is responsible for all backend development and QA, creating a critical risk and bottleneck.","Onboard a dedicated QA Engineer to take over all testing responsibilities, freeing the backend developer to focus on development and support.","Increased development velocity for backend, improved test coverage and quality, and parallelization of dev and QA work, reducing risk by 50%.","7000","4 weeks","Reduced QA-related delays; backend developer utilization on dev tasks increases to >70%.","Avoided project delay of 2+ weeks, saving an estimated $10,000 in resource costs."
"Frontend Knowledge Transfer","Key person dependency on the senior frontend developer for complex components like the Data Table and Mapbox integration.","Mandate pair programming sessions between the senior and mid-level frontend developers for at least 4 hours per week, focused on these complex components.","Mitigates single-point-of-failure risk, upskills the mid-level developer, and improves code quality through continuous review.","","Ongoing (4 weeks)","Mid-level developer can independently handle moderate-complexity bugs/features on the new components by end of project.","Increased team resilience and reduced risk of project delays due to resource unavailability."
