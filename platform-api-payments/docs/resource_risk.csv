"RISK-004","Key Person Dependency","Single DevOps engineer (devops.engineer1) responsible for all foundational infrastructure. Any delay, absence, or departure of this individual will halt the entire project timeline.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-101-01"",""TASK-101-02"",""TASK-101-03"",""TASK-102-01"",""TASK-102-02"",""TASK-102-03"",""TASK-102-04""]","2","Prioritize extensive documentation of Terraform modules and GHA workflows. Mandate peer review of all infrastructure code by tech.lead@company.com.","Engage a pre-vetted DevOps contractor on short notice. Allocate budget for emergency consultation.","Any task assigned to devops.engineer1 is delayed by more than 2 days.","20000","1 week to onboard contractor"
"RISK-001","Technical Complexity","The order checkout Saga pattern is complex and prone to failure mid-transaction, potentially causing financial inconsistencies (payment captured, no order created).","High","Critical","[""TASK-401-02"",""TASK-601-01""]","1.5","Allocate the most senior backend developer (backend.dev1) to this task. Implement comprehensive integration tests for all failure and rollback scenarios.","Develop a runbook and scripts for manual resolution of failed sagas (manual refund or order creation).","Alerts for sagas stuck in a 'compensating' or 'failed' state.","5000","Ongoing monitoring"
"RISK-005","Quality","Single QA engineer has extremely low utilization in early sprints, indicating E2E test automation is back-loaded. This leads to late discovery of integration bugs, increasing rework and risk of production defects.","High","High","[""TASK-201-06"",""TASK-401-05""]","1","Shift QA role left. Re-task qa.engineer1 in Sprint 1 to build the E2E test framework and write integration tests alongside developers for completed services.","Allocate budget for manual regression testing before release if automation falls behind schedule.","Number of automated E2E tests does not increase proportionally with feature completion.","10000","Immediate re-tasking"
