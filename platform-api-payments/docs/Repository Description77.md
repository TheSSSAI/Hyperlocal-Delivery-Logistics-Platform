# 3 Description

This microservice repository is responsible for all financial operations. Its scope is strictly controlled to handle payment processing via Razorpay, processing refunds, calculating platform commissions, and managing the weekly settlement and payout cycle for vendors and riders. By isolating all monetary transactions into this single service, we can tightly control its security, auditing, and compliance scope (especially for PCI-DSS). This is a critical, high-reliability service. Its dependencies have been updated to use the new granular shared libraries.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Financial transactions form a distinct and highly sensitive bounded context. Isolating this service is a primary security and compliance measure. It limits the scope of PCI-DSS compliance to this service alone, reduces the attack surface for financial data, and allows for specialized development practices like immutable, double-entry bookkeeping (REQ-1-082).

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities
