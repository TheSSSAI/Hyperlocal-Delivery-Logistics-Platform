"Staffing","The team is critically understaffed in all development roles, leading to an unrealistic timeline and high risk of burnout and failure.","Execute the 'Recommended Team' hiring plan immediately: Hire 1 Senior Backend Dev, 1 Mid Backend Dev, 1 Mid React Native Dev, and 1 DevOps Contractor.","Brings the project timeline into a realistic 32-week schedule with sustainable team utilization (approx. 85%).","230000","8 weeks (Hiring + Onboarding)","Project velocity aligns with the 32-week plan; team utilization is below 90%.","Enables project delivery, preventing total project failure and loss of investment."
"Cross-training","Single points of failure exist for mobile development, web frontend, and critical backend modules (auth, payments).","Implement mandatory pair programming sessions for all critical and high-complexity stories. Dedicate 5% of each sprint to knowledge sharing.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40% over 6 months. Increases code quality and team resilience.","80","Ongoing","At least two developers are familiar with each critical component, verified by code reviews and task rotation.","Avoids an estimated 4-6 weeks of delay if a key person becomes unavailable."
"Technical Spikes","High-complexity tasks like Saga implementation (RISK-003) and OpenSearch setup (CUS-011) carry high estimation uncertainty.","Prioritize 1-2 week technical spikes for these complex areas before committing to full implementation stories.","De-risks implementation and provides more accurate story point estimates, improving predictability of the project plan.","40","Sprint 4 and Sprint 5","A working proof-of-concept and a clear implementation plan are produced for each spike.","Prevents an estimated 3-5 weeks of rework and delays caused by unforeseen complexity."
