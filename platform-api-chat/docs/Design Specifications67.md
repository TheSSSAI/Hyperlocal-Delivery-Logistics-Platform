# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility is to manage real-time, order-specific chat functionality between customers, vendors, and riders.
- Secondary responsibilities include persisting chat history, managing chat room lifecycles based on order events, and providing a read-only view of chat logs for administrators.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (WebSockets) for the application framework and real-time communication layer.
- Redis for Pub/Sub to enable scalable, multi-instance WebSocket broadcasting and for caching session/room data.
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage of chat messages and room metadata.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be architected as a scalable, cloud-native microservice on AWS EKS to handle a high number of persistent WebSocket connections.
- All client-facing communication must be over Secure WebSockets (WSS), and inter-service communication must be asynchronous via SNS/SQS.
- Message delivery latency must be under 2 seconds to meet real-time user expectations, as established by related feature requirements like REQ-1-061.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Event Consumer: REPO-BE-ORDER (Order Management Service)

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Event Consumer

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

REPO-BE-ORDER (Order Management Service)

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Event-Driven via SNS/SQS

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

The Chat service is fundamentally driven by the order lifecycle. It consumes events like 'order.accepted' to create chat rooms, 'order.rider_assigned' to add participants, and 'order.delivered'/'order.cancelled' to make rooms read-only, as detailed in sequence diagram id:214.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Authentication: Identity & Access Service (AWS Cognito)

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

Authentication

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

Identity & Access Service (AWS Cognito)

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

JWT Validation

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

The service must validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) during the WebSocket connection handshake to authenticate users and authorize their access to order-specific chat rooms, as per REQ-1-096.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Infrastructure: Redis (Amazon ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.3.1 Dependency Type

Infrastructure

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

Redis (Amazon ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

Client Library (e.g., ioredis)

##### 2.1.4.3.4 Reasoning

Redis is critical for scalability. The NestJS WebSocket gateway will use a Redis adapter for its Pub/Sub mechanism to broadcast messages across multiple service instances (pods) running in Kubernetes.

#### 2.1.4.4.0 Infrastructure: PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS)

##### 2.1.4.4.1 Dependency Type

Infrastructure

##### 2.1.4.4.2 Target Component

PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS)

##### 2.1.4.4.3 Integration Pattern

ORM (TypeORM)

##### 2.1.4.4.4 Reasoning

Required for the persistent storage of all chat messages and chat room metadata, ensuring history is available and auditable as per REQ-1-015.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-api-chat' service is a stateful, real-time component whose lifecycle is entirely governed by asynchronous events from the Order service. Its architecture must prioritize scalability of persistent connections and low-latency message broadcasting, justifying its decomposition from a general communications service. Authorization is its most complex business logic, as it's not role-based but context-based (i.e., being an active participant in a specific order).

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-081

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Provide in-app chat for active orders between customer-vendor and customer-rider, including quick-reply templates.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a WebSocket Gateway to handle real-time messaging.
- Requires logic to manage chat 'rooms' on a per-order basis.
- Requires a new REST endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/chat/templates) to serve context-aware quick-reply templates.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- ChatGateway
- ChatService
- ChatTemplatesController

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary functional driver for the service. The implementation must support distinct communication channels within the context of a single order.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-015

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Enforce role-based chat permissions: only parties to an active order can chat, chat becomes read-only upon completion, and administrators have read-only access.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A NestJS 'Guard' must be implemented to authorize WebSocket connections and message events based on order status and user participation.
- The service must consume 'order.delivered' and 'order.cancelled' events to trigger the read-only state change.
- A separate, secured RESTful API (e.g., GET /api/v1/admin/orders/{orderId}/chatlogs) is required for administrator access.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- ChatAuthorizationGuard
- OrderEventsController
- AdminChatController

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement defines the entire security and authorization model for the service, which is its most critical and complex piece of business logic.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

All client-server communication must use Secure WebSocket (WSS). JWTs must be used for authentication. (REQ-1-092, REQ-1-096)

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The service must be deployed behind a load balancer or API Gateway that terminates TLS. The WebSocket gateway's connection handler must include logic to validate JWTs passed during the handshake.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- TLS termination must be handled at the infrastructure level (AWS ALB/API Gateway).
- JWT validation logic will integrate with AWS Cognito's public keys.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Standard security practice for real-time services. NestJS Guards are the ideal pattern for implementing JWT validation on WebSocket connections.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Scalability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

The architecture must handle a high load of concurrent users and scale horizontally. (REQ-1-100)

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The NestJS WebSocket Gateway must be configured with a Redis adapter. This allows multiple pods in the EKS cluster to broadcast messages to all clients in a room, regardless of which pod they are connected to.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- A Redis instance (ElastiCache) is a mandatory infrastructure dependency.
- The application must be stateless, with all session/connection state managed externally (in Redis) to allow for horizontal scaling.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary technical reason this service was decomposed. A standard NestJS gateway without a Redis adapter cannot scale beyond a single instance.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Data Retention

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

Chat logs must be permanently deleted 90 days after order completion. (REQ-1-095)

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

A scheduled job (e.g., a Kubernetes CronJob running a NestJS command) must be created to periodically query the 'chat_messages' table and delete records older than the retention period.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- The deletion query must be indexed on the 'created_at' column.
- The job should run in batches to avoid locking the table for extended periods.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical compliance and cost-management requirement that necessitates a dedicated, automated cleanup process.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The service's requirements are focused on providing a secure, scalable, and real-time communication channel whose lifecycle is entirely dependent on the state of an order. The implementation must be event-driven and lean heavily on NestJS Guards for its complex, context-based authorization logic. Scalability via Redis and data retention via a scheduled job are key non-functional drivers.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

WebSocket Gateway

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

To provide the real-time, bidirectional communication interface for clients. The gateway will manage connections, rooms, and message event handling.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- ChatGateway (implements NestJS OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect)
- ChatAuthorizationGuard

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement a NestJS '@WebSocketGateway()' class configured with a Redis adapter for scalability. Use '@SubscribeMessage()' decorators for handling specific client events like 'sendMessage'.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the fundamental pattern for any real-time messaging service and is natively supported by NestJS, aligning with the mandated tech stack.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Consumer

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- OrderEventsController
- ChatService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Create a NestJS controller with a method decorated to handle incoming messages from an SQS queue. This controller will parse the event payload and delegate the business logic (e.g., create room, make read-only) to the 'ChatService'.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

As confirmed by sequence diagram id:214 and the repository's architecture map, this asynchronous pattern is required for managing chat room state based on external domain events.

### 4.1.3.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.3.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.3.2.0 Pattern Application

To abstract the data persistence logic for chat messages and rooms from the application's business logic.

#### 4.1.3.3.0 Required Components

- ChatMessageRepository

## 6.2.0.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0.0 Protocol Type

Secure WebSocket (WSS)

#### 6.2.1.2.0.0 Implementation Requirements

The NestJS application must be configured to use the WebSocket adapter and deployed behind a TLS-terminating load balancer. A Redis adapter is required for multi-instance support.

#### 6.2.1.3.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Dependency

### 7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The service's scalability is critically dependent on a correctly configured Redis adapter for the NestJS WebSocket gateway. Without it, the service cannot be scaled horizontally beyond a single pod, violating REQ-1-100.

### 7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

The infrastructure setup (IaC) must include an Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) instance. The application's main entrypoint ('main.ts') must correctly instantiate and apply the Redis adapter to the NestJS application.

### 7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary technical challenge and justification for this service's existence. Failure to implement this correctly negates the benefit of decomposing the service.

## 7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Security and Authorization

### 7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The authorization logic is complex, requiring a check against a user's participation in a specific, *active* order for every connection and message. This logic is spread across multiple events and states.

### 7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

A dedicated, well-tested NestJS 'Guard' is essential. This guard will need to be state-aware, querying the 'chat_rooms' table to check the 'is_readonly' flag and participant list on each interaction. This is more complex than a simple role check.

### 7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A flaw in this authorization logic could lead to a severe data breach, allowing users to access chats for orders they are not a part of, violating REQ-1-015.

## 7.3.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Data Management

### 7.3.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The data retention policy (REQ-1-095) requires a separate, automated process for data deletion. This is not part of the core real-time application logic and could be overlooked.

### 7.3.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

A Kubernetes CronJob that runs a scheduled task must be created and deployed. This task will execute a NestJS command ('@nestjs/cli' command) to trigger the deletion service logic. This requires additional infrastructure definition and application code.

### 7.3.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.3.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a compliance requirement. Forgetting to implement the deletion job would lead to non-compliance and uncontrolled data growth over time.

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed using all provided cached context. Repository definition provided the scope and tech stack. Requirements REQ-1-081 and REQ-1-015 defined the core logic. Architectural documents defined patterns like event-driven communication and technologies like EKS and Redis. Database schema id:43 and sequence diagram id:214 provided detailed implementation blueprints for data and interactions.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to use a separate 'chat_rooms' table was made to efficiently manage room state (participants, read-only status) for authorization checks.
- Decision to use a dedicated REST API for admin access was made because WebSocket is unsuitable for a simple request-response log retrieval and simplifies admin authorization.
- Decision to use a Kubernetes CronJob for data retention was made as it's a standard, reliable pattern for scheduled tasks in the specified EKS environment.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that the Order Management service will reliably publish all necessary lifecycle events to a defined SNS topic.
- Assumed that a shared library or standard pattern exists for JWT validation against AWS Cognito.
- Assumed the PostgreSQL database from the overall tech stack (REQ-1-111) is the source of truth for persistence, adapting the DocumentDB schema (id:43) accordingly.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced repository definition (WebSockets, Redis) with architectural requirements (scalability) to confirm the need for a Redis adapter.
- Cross-referenced requirements (REQ-1-015) with sequence diagrams (id:214) to confirm the event-driven logic for making chats read-only.
- Cross-referenced data retention requirement (REQ-1-095) with database schema (id:43) to identify the need for an index on 'created_at' for efficient deletion.
