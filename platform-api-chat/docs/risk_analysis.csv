"RISK-001","External","A major outage or significant latency increase in the primary payment gateway (Razorpay) API could halt all revenue-generating transactions, preventing customers from placing any prepaid orders.","2","5","10","Medium","All payment processing work items (CUS-025, VND-022), financial reconciliation (REQ-1-082), and automated payouts (REQ-1-085).","Single point of failure due to critical dependency on a third-party service for a core business function (payment processing).","Implement a robust circuit breaker pattern (REQ-1-028) to prevent cascading failures. Implement a stateful reconciliation job (REQ-1-058) to handle intermittent webhook/callback failures. Ensure real-time monitoring and alerting on the payment API's error rate and latency.","Develop a documented plan for integrating a pre-vetted secondary payment gateway. In a prolonged outage, temporarily disable online payments and enable only Cash on Delivery (COD) for eligible orders.","Alert triggered when the payment gateway API error rate exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window, or P95 latency exceeds 1500ms.","Lead Backend Engineer (Payments Service)","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The complexity of implementing and testing the Saga pattern for distributed transactions (e.g., order creation, user data erasure) is underestimated, leading to data inconsistencies across microservices and significant development delays.","4","4","16","High","Order placement flow (CUS-025), vendor cancellation (VND-022), user data erasure (CUS-043), and any other workflow spanning multiple microservices (REQ-1-105).","Inherent complexity of maintaining data consistency in a distributed, event-driven architecture without native ACID transactions.","Allocate senior backend engineers to Saga-related tasks. Conduct a time-boxed technical spike to prototype the Saga orchestration logic. Use a well-established library or pattern (e.g., Transactional Outbox) to ensure atomicity between database updates and event publishing.","For the initial MVP, simplify workflows to reduce the number of steps in distributed transactions. Develop detailed operational runbooks and scripts for manually correcting data in case of a failed Saga.","Increase in dead-letter queue (DLQ) messages for Saga-related events. Integration tests for compensating transactions (rollbacks) start failing.","Backend Architect","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","The project relies heavily on a small number of engineers with specialized skills in Terraform and AWS EKS. A key person dependency exists, where the departure or unavailability of the DevOps lead could halt all infrastructure and deployment activities.","2","5","10","Medium","Entire Core Platform & Infrastructure Setup Epic (EPIC-001), including all CI/CD workflows (WS-002) and infrastructure provisioning (WS-001).","Concentration of critical, specialized knowledge in a single individual or a very small team.","Enforce strict Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for all resources with comprehensive documentation. Mandate pair programming for critical infrastructure changes. Cross-train at least two other backend engineers on the Terraform codebase, deployment pipeline, and EKS operational procedures.","Maintain contracts with a certified AWS consulting partner for emergency support. Ensure all access credentials and configurations are stored in a shared, secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager) and not on personal devices.","A pull request for infrastructure changes remains unreviewed for more than 48 hours. A single individual is the sole committer to the Terraform repository over a 30-day period.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","An outage or significant API change in the Mapbox service could disable core logistics functionalities, including rider allocation, ETA calculation, and live tracking, severely impacting the customer and rider experience.","2","4","8","Medium","Rider allocation (REQ-1-078), live tracking (REQ-1-059), address management (CUS-007), and delivery radius enforcement (REQ-1-030).","Single point of failure on a third-party dependency for critical geospatial and routing data.","Implement circuit breaker patterns and robust error handling for all Mapbox API calls. Cache static geocoding results where feasible. Pin the API version being used to prevent unexpected breaking changes (REQ-1-091). Implement contract tests for the Mapbox API.","Develop a 'degraded mode' of operation where live tracking is disabled but core ordering can continue. Maintain a shortlist of alternative mapping service providers (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Here) for potential migration.","Alert triggered when Mapbox API error rate exceeds 10% over a 5-minute window or P95 latency surpasses 1000ms.","Lead Backend Engineer (Logistics Service)","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The real-time WebSocket infrastructure for chat and live tracking is not sufficiently load-tested, leading to scalability issues, dropped connections, and message delivery failures under peak load (e.g., 10,000 concurrent users).","3","4","12","Medium","Live Delivery Tracking (REQ-1-059), In-app Chat (REQ-1-081), and all related user stories (CUS-028, CUS-031, CUS-032, VND-024).","Stateful services like WebSockets are inherently more complex to scale and test than stateless REST APIs, and their performance characteristics are often overlooked.","Dedicate a specific performance testing cycle for the WebSocket service using tools like k6. Use a scalable WebSocket adapter (e.g., Redis-based) in the NestJS application. Implement robust client-side reconnection logic with exponential backoff.","If scalability issues are discovered late, temporarily disable the chat feature and switch live tracking to a less frequent polling mechanism (e.g., every 30 seconds via REST API) as a fallback.","WebSocket connection error rate exceeds 2%. P95 message delivery latency exceeds 2 seconds. Server CPU/memory utilization for WebSocket pods exceeds 80%.","QA Lead / Performance Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The data anonymization process for the 'Right to Erasure' feature is implemented incorrectly, leading to either incomplete removal of PII (a compliance breach) or accidental deletion of critical, non-PII transactional data required for financial audits.","3","5","15","High","User data erasure (CUS-043, REQ-1-023), and automated data retention job (SYS-009, REQ-1-095).","High complexity of a destructive, distributed data modification process that must precisely distinguish between PII and non-PII across multiple microservices.","The anonymization process must be implemented as an idempotent, asynchronous Saga. Create a comprehensive data map of all PII fields across the entire system. The process must be extensively tested in a staging environment with a restored production-like dataset. Require multiple peer reviews for all related code.","Implement a 'soft-anonymization' first, which flags data for anonymization without immediate modification, allowing for a review period. Maintain database backups for a sufficient period (REQ-1-094) to allow for recovery from a catastrophic error.","Automated tests that verify the integrity of financial records for anonymized users start failing. Manual spot-checks by QA reveal remaining PII after an erasure process.","Backend Architect / Compliance Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","The setup and stabilization of the full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry) is delayed, forcing the project to launch with significant monitoring gaps, making it difficult to debug performance issues and production incidents.","3","4","12","Medium","All operational readiness tasks (REQ-1-108, REQ-1-109, REQ-1-110). Delays debugging and stabilization for all microservices.","Observability is often treated as a 'nice-to-have' feature and de-prioritized, despite its critical role in operating a distributed system.","Treat observability as a core feature and allocate dedicated developer time early in the project. Use managed services where possible (e.g., AWS Managed Service for Prometheus/Grafana) to reduce setup overhead. Develop a standardized instrumentation library to be used by all microservices.","Initially rely on basic AWS CloudWatch metrics and structured logging for monitoring if the full stack is delayed. This provides minimal visibility but is better than none. Prioritize implementing distributed tracing (`correlationId`) first, as it provides the most value for debugging.","Key operational dashboards in Grafana are not functional two sprints before the planned go-live date. Microservices are deployed without Prometheus metric endpoints.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-31","Not Started"
